1,4,"I love flo so much. It's been the only tracker to adapt to an irregular period cycle right away, which has been such a big help to me. I love all the chats with others going through similar things and I love that I'm able to share it all with my boyfriend on his phone. it makes our lives easier. however, I really wish it had a way to track how different birth controls are affecting you and track insertion dates for non pill options, and maybe a reminder when to book that Dr visit."
2,1,"Downloaded the app, only to be asked 3 million questions (some that had nothing to do with tracking ovulation), and then had to press some button on the screen for several seconds to ""commit"" to the app (super corny and annoying), only to then be told I had to pay yearly or monthly. The process is very tedious and frustrating. It doesn't matter what you click on on the app, if you haven't paid, you can't read anything. Frustrating and annoying experience. Uninstalling."
3,4,"Incredibly useful for tracking periods, as it adjusts to changes. I wish we could turn off, or skip parts of, the bot chat stuff. Its programming/information is too general and ultimately restrictive. I also would like more symptom options, even just an add your own that you can select again as needed. Thanks for the app!"
4,2,"I've had this app for about 5 years and really just used it to track my periods, which it is decent for. But over time, more and more features have been locked behind a paywall and I got very annoyed at the pop-ups telling me to buy a plan. The final straw was a bug that kept putting my symptoms on one day and my flow on the next, despite logging both on the same day. I just don't see the point in continuing to use an annoying and buggy app. I plan on tracking my periods on paper now."
5,1,"The only reason I still use this app is because it's been my tracking app for the last 8 years now. They keep taking away free features and making them only available with the paid subscription. I'm now pregnant again for the third time and now it won't even tell me anything other than how far along I am. Any insight it offers is no longer free! I have a feeling soon it won't even be free to use it at all. I would switch if it were easy to export my data into another app, but it's not."
6,2,"I loved this app, it was accurate and it allowed me to track my periods as well as my ovulation dates AND allowed me to monitor any abnormalities and as someone who has always had very irregular periods it was great. However now they want me to pay for all the things that made it great and I can no longer monitor for any issues like I used to without paying?! As women we are already nickel and dimed for items like pads and I might as well just go back to using a calendar if all I get is tracking"
7,2,"Some of the couples quizzes and information are kinda nice but as a period tracker couple sharing app it's terrible. She puts all her information in in detail and I get practically none of that information on my side even though that was our intention. There is no setting to change it either, it's locked away. I would understand if it was a privacy thing for some couples but it should be an option in her settings not locked away for everyone."
8,1,"Great for period tracking. Before pregnancy 5 star. Postpartum, more like a 1 star app. Now it seems the app is struggling. The calendar knows I was pregnant but does not take into account postpartum or breastfeeding. Just wish there was an option to put in breastfeeding and postpartum, so it's not constantly trying to tell me something is wrong with my cycle."
9,2,"It's nice to be able to track my period but instead of grabbing a pen and paper to do that I downloaded this because with how much is in the app I thought there would be more for free then just a period calendar. I expected understand and insights, and yet everything little thing I clicked on I had to pay for. The thing is, is that I would have paid for it if there was a bit more for free. This app wasn't created to help it was created for self purposes. nothing on here to help is for free."
10,3,"I've been using Flo for 5+ years, and it has been mostly great. Flo can predict my period often down to the day, and is helpful for tracking ovulation. Unfortunately in more recent years, they have progressively gotten rid of a lot of the free features that used to be included (such as evaluation chats, and articles), that now you have to pay for premium to use. It feels like everything that would be helpful to use to learn more about your cycle, they want you to have premium to access."
11,2,I wanna give it more stars become it is the best when it comes to tracking and getting tips and tricks for anything but I'm saying two stars because you only have access to like two things unless you pay. it's ridiculously expensive. why the heck do we have to pay for a pregnancy tracker or a health tracker in general. if we need the help and guidance it should be free our health shouldn't come with a cost. it's literally useless app without premium. please do something I loved this app
12,3,"I used to really like the app because for the free verison, yoi still got some knowledge about things you log or when you're pregnant, really helpful info about the baby as it grows. I got a new phone and couldn't access my account wasn't a big deal, bc I just made a new one, but now I cant acces I was able b4 other than logging my symptoms or settings. I can't look pretty much anything on the app bc it just puts me on page to buy the premium option. Im even locked out from the calendar."
13,3,"overall balanced app. 1 big nit pick is how you enter your weight. maybe some find having to spin and spin the weight wheele pleasing, I do not. if you could just tap and enter it like most other apps I would be more inclined to increase the rating. the other thing I noticed is that the overall design is simple but almost lacks in esthetic. back ground options, better/ more intricate designs. something of that nature would be awesome. these 2 things would add a star each in my opinion."
14,2,"it used to be a great app for tracking my period. once I paid for premium all it does is send me ads to renew which is so annoying. Whenever the app has a glitch and I have to reinstall it, it takes 15 mins to skip all of the questions,log back into my account. All of the information it had about pregnancy was inaccurate. The estimated sizes didn't match anything that I sourced from other sites, plus considering I was paying a premium for the feature the BUMP was free, accurate with 3D images."
15,4,"Overall great experience with this app. There are a few selections I'd love to see added. I had to stop birth control (after 16 years) for health reasons, and I wanted to keep track of my cycle as my body regulated, and so I could reduce my chances of getting pregnant, but that's not an option when asked why I got the app. I also use this as a mood/general well-being tracker, and noting how much quality sleep I got the night before would be super helpful to spot patterns there."
16,1,"This app is seriously one of those that are only out there for whatever they can get from whatever sucker is naive enough to sign up for my free trial. Most apps/companies have no problem refunding you- especially if it's within 5 minutes of being charged and reaching out to their customer service. They charged me at midnight, hoping I would not see, but I did. I find their services useless, that's why I deleted it a day after I downloaded it, I just forgot to cancel my subscription. üö´‚ùåüö´"
17,1,"I answered a million questions only to be told I had to pay a subscription for the data analysis. I declined and then got a message saying ""befire you start, we have a gift for you"". I clicked on it to find out that it was just a discounted yearly subscription. Even though I had not gotten a subscription, there was a box on my home page saying ""today's chance of pregnancy"" with a tick underneath but when I clicked, I was taken to the page of different subscriptions."
18,2,I had this app years ago and loved it so decided to download it again a couple of months ago. I'm disappointed in the amount of times I'm being asked to pay for a subscription. I used this app before with very minimal ads and there was no pressure to pay for premium. And now I can't escape the pop-ups multiple times just by opening the app I find myself just ignoring it and not actually using it because you're constantly being pushed to buy l.
19,1,dislike it. you have to subscribe and pay to view the simplest things on the app. not worth it unless you pay. the max you can do there is just tract your cycle. you can't use anything else mor read anything on there unless you pay. get another app that can help you and an app where you can do much more. this is not worth it. if you don't want to pay every month. and it's pretty expensive too when other apps offer so much more without paying.
20,1,"Edit 2025: my last review was complaining about the constant pop-ups and chats, that would only be useful if I paid for premium. I don't need them, anyway. Recently I got a new phone, and all of my tracking data for the last 2 years disappeared. So, I'm starting from scratch. I only need this to track my phases, which it can barely do, apparently. Will probably just transition to my Fitbit app exclusively, since it still has all my data from 2018 no problem."

61,1,"I've used the app for 9 years or so. App is only good for basic tracking unless you want to pay extra, I can do that on a paper calendar. The amount of stuff behind a pay wall is ridiculous and out of hand. I'm officially going to start looking for a different app. plus the data leaks? no thanks."
62,1,"I enjoyed using this app and it was always somewhat accurate but it kicked me out of my account for no reason. i switched phones and tried signing back in but it wont accept my email or password (which i know is correct) and when I tried to send reset instructions to my email, it won't send. this is all right after I finally caved and paid for the subscription. Now I can't even access the app."
63,1,"I have been apart of Flo since it's release and it's so sad to see the money grab app it's turned into today. Some of us use this app just to stay organized about the changes in our cycles, now you can't even open the app or navigate through it without a pop up begging for money. If I didn't only use it 5 days out of the month or didn't have 10 years worth of data stored I'd probably switch apps. Plus there's a whole class action lawsuit going on so that's fun!"
64,4,Great app! Very helpful! Just wish it weren't so pushy with premium. Everytime I go into the app it sends me a pop-up asking me to talk about how I feel because of that time. I try to ignore it but I really wish I could turn off those pop-ups. Other than that it's a solid period tracker. Even for my irregular cycles.
65,3,"I've used this app for 6+ years and I really loved it. unfortunately for the past year or two the app has been fairly glitchy for me. It no longer saves my logged periods to the point it's telling me I'm over a year late. it fails to predict cycle dates too. finally having to let this app go, which is sad as I've used it with all of my pregnancies."
66,2,"it was wonderful for years until now. the most essential features are officially only accessible via payment. tracking is useless to me now with all the information essentially being held hostage with a price point. five years ago, it was awesome. all the information was generally free. now with the most basic feature (fertility prediction and chances of conception) locked up and only being able to track *symptoms* I have grown to hate this once lovable and arguably essential tool."
67,2,"I used this app free for years and was happy with it's basic prediction functions, but recently I switched phones and all my data was lost. The login feature is totally broken and no matter which option I choose it takes me to an error page. I guess I won't miss the constant push for premium now that I've switched to a new app."
68,5,This app is great for tracking and predicting your period. I really like that you can change the focus based on your goals like getting pregnant or just simply tracking your cycle. I use the app all the time to plan trips. There are also some good articles and recommendations from professionals in the app. I would recommend this app.
69,3,this app could be awesome if there was a bit more inclusivity. I want to track my hormonal cycles while I have an IUD and there's no options without actively bleeding. there's also no entries for some of my regular symptoms and it is 99% centered around pregnancy and ovulation. theres a lot more to women's hormonal health and cycles and I would love to see an app like this that wasn't targeted at women trying to get pregnant or avoid getting pregnant.
70,3,"App is great for tracking moods, periods, and many other symptoms that helped me understand my body better. I had premium for a year or two and the advice didn't really change or was specifically tailored to me. I stopped premium and now when I click on content I'm not allowed to see anything, even though I thought some of it was basic health knowledge."
71,3,"I like Flo and have been using it for years. There's a few things that could be improved, though. #1, Paywall; having the insights behind a paywall is nonsense. Offer them as a one-time low-cost payment to have access if need be. #2, the constant pop-up to subscribe; this is beyond annoying. #3, no sign-in after a reinstall; having to go through that whole questionnaire process again is frustrating & time consuming. #4 Subscription cost; absolutely ridiculous for a period tracker app."
72,1,"worst tracking app. I'm so tired of getting asked for money. Especially when most of the ""advice"" or reasoning for things can be simply googled. Thought it would be convenient to have an app that has it all in one place, but paying for that is outrageous and comical. And usually I have no issue with apps that have a subscription, to each their own if they want to pay for a membership, don't care. But there is no touching anything on the app without the dang pop up to pay"
73,4,"update: had to re-login after getting a new phone and there needs to be an option to login before the long intro sequence. The intro should also just be fully skippable, and I could do without the ""long press"" to set my intentions. While I appreciate the personalization, forcing us to click through feels condescending. It's up to me why I use this app, that's the whole point. The process is enough to scare off new users as well. I've used flo for a long time, but these changes give me pause."
74,2,"it's fine for tracking periods, but it won't stop shoving a subscription in your face. It feels like every time you open the app, every time you click on something, read something, close something, it has to ask if you want to buy a subscription. It gets real annoying real fast. There are probably better tracker apps out there tbh."
75,2,"This app has a hard time with my irregular periods. When I log a period it doesn't always restart my cycle. Because of that, it often tells me to take pregnancy tests when I know I'm not pregnant. That chat bot conversations aren't very informative or personalized. I regret paying for the app for a year. I can see how it'd be useful for someone with more regular periods."
76,1,"I stopped paying for it when they started to give false biology. the app does nothing special other than track your pregnancy and period while looking pretty. other than that it prohibits the basic free information you can get from Google unless you pay for it to be shown on the app, there are several free apps that provide way more accurate information and articles without making a subscription. everything in the app is achievable for free."
77,4,"it's a very good tracker, and most of my periods have been right on track, I appreciate they allow a free trial, which is great, and I understand this can't be free but most things are restricted the only thing you can really do is track and chat with strangers but sometimes its not that helpful, Not everyone has money for it, and I think a simple solution is to allow at least 3 free articles, but this is just a recommendation."
78,2,"I believe the app would be really great If not for the constant asking to pay for the subscription. A reminder from time to time is fine, but it's a little overwhelming when it's done too much. A change in that direction would definitely make people more eager to actually consider the payment, while now it just gets annoying instead of encouraging."
79,1,"This app will let you open the app without creating an account. If you have to replace your phone or app is removed, you will never get your medical data back. The yrs of logging your data is just gone. If you remember info and want to back log, you can't. I'm very disappointed with how they can not pull up my account, even after sending proof of payment from my email. I'm pregnant right now and had important info in notes. Save your time and go somewhere else."
80,2,"It's advertised as one of the best ""free"" period tracking apps (which is why I downloaded), but every touchpoint is interrupted by a pay wall. It will waste your time with seemingly ""complimentary"" features only to hit you with the credit card request 20 questions in. Super annoying. would love a suggestion for an alternative. I think if you're trying to get pregnant it makes sense to pay, but it's annoying they advertise so much as a ""free"" platform when that tier is REALLY annoying to use"
81,4,"I love flo so much. It's been the only tracker to adapt to an irregular period cycle right away, which has been such a big help to me. I love all the chats with others going through similar things and I love that I'm able to share it all with my boyfriend on his phone. it makes our lives easier. however, I really wish it had a way to track how different birth controls are affecting you and track insertion dates for non pill options, and maybe a reminder when to book that Dr visit."
82,1,"Downloaded the app, only to be asked 3 million questions (some that had nothing to do with tracking ovulation), and then had to press some button on the screen for several seconds to ""commit"" to the app (super corny and annoying), only to then be told I had to pay yearly or monthly. The process is very tedious and frustrating. It doesn't matter what you click on on the app, if you haven't paid, you can't read anything. Frustrating and annoying experience. Uninstalling."
83,4,"Incredibly useful for tracking periods, as it adjusts to changes. I wish we could turn off, or skip parts of, the bot chat stuff. Its programming/information is too general and ultimately restrictive. I also would like more symptom options, even just an add your own that you can select again as needed. Thanks for the app!"
84,2,"I've had this app for about 5 years and really just used it to track my periods, which it is decent for. But over time, more and more features have been locked behind a paywall and I got very annoyed at the pop-ups telling me to buy a plan. The final straw was a bug that kept putting my symptoms on one day and my flow on the next, despite logging both on the same day. I just don't see the point in continuing to use an annoying and buggy app. I plan on tracking my periods on paper now."
85,1,"The only reason I still use this app is because it's been my tracking app for the last 8 years now. They keep taking away free features and making them only available with the paid subscription. I'm now pregnant again for the third time and now it won't even tell me anything other than how far along I am. Any insight it offers is no longer free! I have a feeling soon it won't even be free to use it at all. I would switch if it were easy to export my data into another app, but it's not."
86,2,"I loved this app, it was accurate and it allowed me to track my periods as well as my ovulation dates AND allowed me to monitor any abnormalities and as someone who has always had very irregular periods it was great. However now they want me to pay for all the things that made it great and I can no longer monitor for any issues like I used to without paying?! As women we are already nickel and dimed for items like pads and I might as well just go back to using a calendar if all I get is tracking"
87,2,"Some of the couples quizzes and information are kinda nice but as a period tracker couple sharing app it's terrible. She puts all her information in in detail and I get practically none of that information on my side even though that was our intention. There is no setting to change it either, it's locked away. I would understand if it was a privacy thing for some couples but it should be an option in her settings not locked away for everyone."
88,1,"Great for period tracking. Before pregnancy 5 star. Postpartum, more like a 1 star app. Now it seems the app is struggling. The calendar knows I was pregnant but does not take into account postpartum or breastfeeding. Just wish there was an option to put in breastfeeding and postpartum, so it's not constantly trying to tell me something is wrong with my cycle."
89,2,"It's nice to be able to track my period but instead of grabbing a pen and paper to do that I downloaded this because with how much is in the app I thought there would be more for free then just a period calendar. I expected understand and insights, and yet everything little thing I clicked on I had to pay for. The thing is, is that I would have paid for it if there was a bit more for free. This app wasn't created to help it was created for self purposes. nothing on here to help is for free."
90,3,"I've been using Flo for 5+ years, and it has been mostly great. Flo can predict my period often down to the day, and is helpful for tracking ovulation. Unfortunately in more recent years, they have progressively gotten rid of a lot of the free features that used to be included (such as evaluation chats, and articles), that now you have to pay for premium to use. It feels like everything that would be helpful to use to learn more about your cycle, they want you to have premium to access."
91,2,I wanna give it more stars become it is the best when it comes to tracking and getting tips and tricks for anything but I'm saying two stars because you only have access to like two things unless you pay. it's ridiculously expensive. why the heck do we have to pay for a pregnancy tracker or a health tracker in general. if we need the help and guidance it should be free our health shouldn't come with a cost. it's literally useless app without premium. please do something I loved this app
92,3,"I used to really like the app because for the free verison, yoi still got some knowledge about things you log or when you're pregnant, really helpful info about the baby as it grows. I got a new phone and couldn't access my account wasn't a big deal, bc I just made a new one, but now I cant acces I was able b4 other than logging my symptoms or settings. I can't look pretty much anything on the app bc it just puts me on page to buy the premium option. Im even locked out from the calendar."
93,3,"overall balanced app. 1 big nit pick is how you enter your weight. maybe some find having to spin and spin the weight wheele pleasing, I do not. if you could just tap and enter it like most other apps I would be more inclined to increase the rating. the other thing I noticed is that the overall design is simple but almost lacks in esthetic. back ground options, better/ more intricate designs. something of that nature would be awesome. these 2 things would add a star each in my opinion."
94,2,"it used to be a great app for tracking my period. once I paid for premium all it does is send me ads to renew which is so annoying. Whenever the app has a glitch and I have to reinstall it, it takes 15 mins to skip all of the questions,log back into my account. All of the information it had about pregnancy was inaccurate. The estimated sizes didn't match anything that I sourced from other sites, plus considering I was paying a premium for the feature the BUMP was free, accurate with 3D images."
95,4,"Overall great experience with this app. There are a few selections I'd love to see added. I had to stop birth control (after 16 years) for health reasons, and I wanted to keep track of my cycle as my body regulated, and so I could reduce my chances of getting pregnant, but that's not an option when asked why I got the app. I also use this as a mood/general well-being tracker, and noting how much quality sleep I got the night before would be super helpful to spot patterns there."
96,1,"This app is seriously one of those that are only out there for whatever they can get from whatever sucker is naive enough to sign up for my free trial. Most apps/companies have no problem refunding you- especially if it's within 5 minutes of being charged and reaching out to their customer service. They charged me at midnight, hoping I would not see, but I did. I find their services useless, that's why I deleted it a day after I downloaded it, I just forgot to cancel my subscription. üö´‚ùåüö´"
97,1,"I answered a million questions only to be told I had to pay a subscription for the data analysis. I declined and then got a message saying ""befire you start, we have a gift for you"". I clicked on it to find out that it was just a discounted yearly subscription. Even though I had not gotten a subscription, there was a box on my home page saying ""today's chance of pregnancy"" with a tick underneath but when I clicked, I was taken to the page of different subscriptions."
98,2,I had this app years ago and loved it so decided to download it again a couple of months ago. I'm disappointed in the amount of times I'm being asked to pay for a subscription. I used this app before with very minimal ads and there was no pressure to pay for premium. And now I can't escape the pop-ups multiple times just by opening the app I find myself just ignoring it and not actually using it because you're constantly being pushed to buy l.
99,1,dislike it. you have to subscribe and pay to view the simplest things on the app. not worth it unless you pay. the max you can do there is just tract your cycle. you can't use anything else mor read anything on there unless you pay. get another app that can help you and an app where you can do much more. this is not worth it. if you don't want to pay every month. and it's pretty expensive too when other apps offer so much more without paying.
100,1,"Edit 2025: my last review was complaining about the constant pop-ups and chats, that would only be useful if I paid for premium. I don't need them, anyway. Recently I got a new phone, and all of my tracking data for the last 2 years disappeared. So, I'm starting from scratch. I only need this to track my phases, which it can barely do, apparently. Will probably just transition to my Fitbit app exclusively, since it still has all my data from 2018 no problem."
101,1,"I've used the app for 9 years or so. App is only good for basic tracking unless you want to pay extra, I can do that on a paper calendar. The amount of stuff behind a pay wall is ridiculous and out of hand. I'm officially going to start looking for a different app. plus the data leaks? no thanks."
102,1,"I enjoyed using this app and it was always somewhat accurate but it kicked me out of my account for no reason. i switched phones and tried signing back in but it wont accept my email or password (which i know is correct) and when I tried to send reset instructions to my email, it won't send. this is all right after I finally caved and paid for the subscription. Now I can't even access the app."
103,1,"I have been apart of Flo since it's release and it's so sad to see the money grab app it's turned into today. Some of us use this app just to stay organized about the changes in our cycles, now you can't even open the app or navigate through it without a pop up begging for money. If I didn't only use it 5 days out of the month or didn't have 10 years worth of data stored I'd probably switch apps. Plus there's a whole class action lawsuit going on so that's fun!"
104,4,Great app! Very helpful! Just wish it weren't so pushy with premium. Everytime I go into the app it sends me a pop-up asking me to talk about how I feel because of that time. I try to ignore it but I really wish I could turn off those pop-ups. Other than that it's a solid period tracker. Even for my irregular cycles.
105,3,"I've used this app for 6+ years and I really loved it. unfortunately for the past year or two the app has been fairly glitchy for me. It no longer saves my logged periods to the point it's telling me I'm over a year late. it fails to predict cycle dates too. finally having to let this app go, which is sad as I've used it with all of my pregnancies."
106,2,"it was wonderful for years until now. the most essential features are officially only accessible via payment. tracking is useless to me now with all the information essentially being held hostage with a price point. five years ago, it was awesome. all the information was generally free. now with the most basic feature (fertility prediction and chances of conception) locked up and only being able to track *symptoms* I have grown to hate this once lovable and arguably essential tool."
107,2,"I used this app free for years and was happy with it's basic prediction functions, but recently I switched phones and all my data was lost. The login feature is totally broken and no matter which option I choose it takes me to an error page. I guess I won't miss the constant push for premium now that I've switched to a new app."
108,5,This app is great for tracking and predicting your period. I really like that you can change the focus based on your goals like getting pregnant or just simply tracking your cycle. I use the app all the time to plan trips. There are also some good articles and recommendations from professionals in the app. I would recommend this app.
109,3,this app could be awesome if there was a bit more inclusivity. I want to track my hormonal cycles while I have an IUD and there's no options without actively bleeding. there's also no entries for some of my regular symptoms and it is 99% centered around pregnancy and ovulation. theres a lot more to women's hormonal health and cycles and I would love to see an app like this that wasn't targeted at women trying to get pregnant or avoid getting pregnant.
110,3,"App is great for tracking moods, periods, and many other symptoms that helped me understand my body better. I had premium for a year or two and the advice didn't really change or was specifically tailored to me. I stopped premium and now when I click on content I'm not allowed to see anything, even though I thought some of it was basic health knowledge."
111,3,"I like Flo and have been using it for years. There's a few things that could be improved, though. #1, Paywall; having the insights behind a paywall is nonsense. Offer them as a one-time low-cost payment to have access if need be. #2, the constant pop-up to subscribe; this is beyond annoying. #3, no sign-in after a reinstall; having to go through that whole questionnaire process again is frustrating & time consuming. #4 Subscription cost; absolutely ridiculous for a period tracker app."
112,1,"worst tracking app. I'm so tired of getting asked for money. Especially when most of the ""advice"" or reasoning for things can be simply googled. Thought it would be convenient to have an app that has it all in one place, but paying for that is outrageous and comical. And usually I have no issue with apps that have a subscription, to each their own if they want to pay for a membership, don't care. But there is no touching anything on the app without the dang pop up to pay"
113,4,"update: had to re-login after getting a new phone and there needs to be an option to login before the long intro sequence. The intro should also just be fully skippable, and I could do without the ""long press"" to set my intentions. While I appreciate the personalization, forcing us to click through feels condescending. It's up to me why I use this app, that's the whole point. The process is enough to scare off new users as well. I've used flo for a long time, but these changes give me pause."

I think if you're trying to get pregnant it makes sense to pay, but it's annoying they advertise so much as a ""free"" platform when that tier is REALLY annoying to use"
121,4,"The app is great and really helped me understand my body and menstrual cycle better. One suggestion: please consider recording menstrual days based on the exact time it starts (e.g. 9 PM) instead of counting it as a full day. Also, it would be better if we get to track the amount of exercise, vaginal discharge, and sleep hours. These details can support a more personalized and effective women‚Äôs health routine. Keep up the great work!"
122,2,"I've had this app for a few years now, i love that it will tell me when my monthly is coming but I hate how it is constantly telling to sign up for a plan. Why give me the option to learn more about MY body but then turn around and put a price tage on it. 7.99 a month is crazy but 39.99 a year is too. Especially for a teenage girl who's just now learning everything. Like I want to learn more about me and my body without losing money."
123,5,love this app and the support team. I had an old email address I deleted that I had used to sign up for flo with and when I got a new phone I couldn't access my account!! fortunately however I'd used a different account to purchase premium with and support managed to merge the accounts so I could access my 2 years of data with!! they were so helpful and just lovely!!
124,2,"I've been using this app for about a decade now. It was the first app I downloaded to help me track my irregular periods. This app helped me communicate with my doctor and my partner better and helped me get insight into my body. At first, you could get information you could google for free now. You have to pay for the short articles or to be diagnosed. Every time I open the app, there is one less free feature."
125,2,Have been using this app for about two years or so. Used to be a really good app but now you cannot use most of the features without it pestering for you to buy their premium subscription. It seems that they have taken most of the insights and features away from the free download and want you to pay the subscription for them now.
126,2,"it's very good at tracking your period but the reason I downloaded the app, is locked behind a pay wall üòû. I wanted the advice features and how to deal with certain things as a teenager but you can't click on anything without it being included in the premium membership. I wish flo could make it more accessible for teens that most likely don't have money but still wants advice üòÖ"
127,1,"This app asks for preferences, whether you're in a relationship, sexually active, etc. and then promptly ignores all your preferences and shows you articles and notifications about the stuff you didn't ask for anyway. This, of course, is only after premium has been thrown in your face so many times you forget that this app even has a single free feature. Which it really doesn't, their chat bot can't finish a complete thought without pulling out the beggar routine. wouldn't recommend"
128,5,I originally wanted to use this so I could compare calendars with another app and I've only had it for like 2 days so far but I actually really love all the features. my Fianc√© is able to look at a lot more information than the other one I had and it asks a lot of questions. I'm about to find out if all the questions help with accurate information because this says my monthly is due tomorrow and my other one says a little under a week. I'll report back soon
129,5,"This app is truly amazing, had it since high school. I will give this app 5 stars if you guys added in the other forms of birth control that other women like myself have that might cause you not to have your period for a whole year or 2. I think that would be a game changer for you guys. Keep doing your thing ü§óüíï Edit: Nevermind, I just found those options in the app, 5 stars!!!"
130,2,"The app is pretty decent. I downloaded it just to track my period, so all the sex life and pregnancy tracking questions weren't the best thing to open the app to, and as a queer asexual person it was not very fun to be bombarded with all that. Especially since I'm fairly sure that all of those sex education were about straight sex. Which leads to my second critique of the app, without paying all the insights and articles are off limit. This app is pretty much just a period tracker with sex ads."
131,2,"This is a great app, with the major exception that this app really pushes the monthly or yearly subscription at every possible opportunity. If you don't want or can't afford the subscription, it's a real pain. I just want to track my cycle. It would be amazing if I could turn off the articles (most of which need a subscription to read). However, for tracking your period, this app is the best on the market (I've tried a fair number)."
132,4,"I've used this app for many years and love the prediction and analysis data and anonymous features. The bad is that while I understand the purpose of premium, I feel like it gets push way too frequently and caused me to use the app less (only for tracking). When they introduced the partner feature, it was so limited that my partner paid for the premium which then gave it to me. The partner feature is great but needs some work which I'll submit through their email."
133,1,"Used to be the best tracking app ever and I've been using it for the past 8-9 years. Unfortunately, it has been made clear that now they just care about money because half the things you used to be able to read/learn/do on the app now are hidden behind a paywall when they didn't use to be. Literally feel like I can't click anything without being told I need to have a subscription now. Finishing my pregnancy out with it just for tracking the weeks then switching to a different period tracker."
134,2,"if you're a free user this app is really annoying. they dont clearly state what is a premium feature, so you end up clicking on many things only to get a prompt to subscribe. I understand its a business and you need money. but all other apps show what's premium by using a star or crown icon on those features so you can make the decision for yourself if you want to click. this has given me a really negative view on the app even though the premium stuff looks really interesting bc I feel tricked"
135,4,"it's simple and I like the features they have, but almost all of them are behind a paywall except the symptoms tracker. don't expect much else from this app unless you plan on paying for it. And to be honest forcing people to pay for health education leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I'm not saying make the whole app free, but at least leave important/basic information available to everyone."
136,1,"EDIT:Still 1 ‚≠êÔ∏è.After being told there is a free version with a tracker & notifications, it took 5 tries to close out the subscription popup.I wasn't told all you can track is your period. I get notifications for other categories I expressed interest in, but can't access any w/o paying.Subscription popups are aggressive & constant.Free version should have access to most of the other features, even if limited to use, instead of forced to do a free trial.Bad way to gain customers.I hope it's fixed"
137,5,"One of the best period tracking apps. I have been using it for over a year or two and the predictions are so accurate, it's so helpful to know exactly what's going on with your body! The flo assistant insights are really helpful as well, the secret chat is a great feature too! Girl to girl conversations without the fear of judgement are so refreshing."
138,1,"I wanted to download a copy of my data. This is not an option in the app and you are required to contact the app support email. You only receive the same ""copy and paste"" AI generated responses via email from a 3rd party service when you attempt to contact their app support. Despite requesting a copy multiple times, Flo will not provide me with a full copy of my own period/fertility data!"
139,4,"overall very accurate. whether it be predicting how I'm going to feel or other things like that, it's very helpful. one thing I don't like is how you have to pay for half of the features. don't get me wrong, if a had the money I 100% would buy premium because it is definitely worth it, but I don't have the money so unfortunately I cant. Great app though, would recommend as a period tracked!"
140,3,"Have used this app for years. Over all I like it, easy to use/ view all the data you put in. Originally you had access to all of the extra information, slowly alot of it was blocked unless you paid. Now apart from your calander/ entering symptoms you can't view anything unless you pay and you get constant pop ups trying to get you to subscribe making 90% of the apps features redundant. Think i'll start hunting around for a new app now."
141,4,"I love flo so much. It's been the only tracker to adapt to an irregular period cycle right away, which has been such a big help to me. I love all the chats with others going through similar things and I love that I'm able to share it all with my boyfriend on his phone. it makes our lives easier. however, I really wish it had a way to track how different birth controls are affecting you and track insertion dates for non pill options, and maybe a reminder when to book that Dr visit."
142,1,"Downloaded the app, only to be asked 3 million questions (some that had nothing to do with tracking ovulation), and then had to press some button on the screen for several seconds to ""commit"" to the app (super corny and annoying), only to then be told I had to pay yearly or monthly. The process is very tedious and frustrating. It doesn't matter what you click on on the app, if you haven't paid, you can't read anything. Frustrating and annoying experience. Uninstalling."
143,4,"Incredibly useful for tracking periods, as it adjusts to changes. I wish we could turn off, or skip parts of, the bot chat stuff. Its programming/information is too general and ultimately restrictive. I also would like more symptom options, even just an add your own that you can select again as needed. Thanks for the app!"
144,2,"I've had this app for about 5 years and really just used it to track my periods, which it is decent for. But over time, more and more features have been locked behind a paywall and I got very annoyed at the pop-ups telling me to buy a plan. The final straw was a bug that kept putting my symptoms on one day and my flow on the next, despite logging both on the same day. I just don't see the point in continuing to use an annoying and buggy app. I plan on tracking my periods on paper now."
145,1,"The only reason I still use this app is because it's been my tracking app for the last 8 years now. They keep taking away free features and making them only available with the paid subscription. I'm now pregnant again for the third time and now it won't even tell me anything other than how far along I am. Any insight it offers is no longer free! I have a feeling soon it won't even be free to use it at all. I would switch if it were easy to export my data into another app, but it's not."
146,2,"I loved this app, it was accurate and it allowed me to track my periods as well as my ovulation dates AND allowed me to monitor any abnormalities and as someone who has always had very irregular periods it was great. However now they want me to pay for all the things that made it great and I can no longer monitor for any issues like I used to without paying?! As women we are already nickel and dimed for items like pads and I might as well just go back to using a calendar if all I get is tracking"
147,2,"Some of the couples quizzes and information are kinda nice but as a period tracker couple sharing app it's terrible. She puts all her information in in detail and I get practically none of that information on my side even though that was our intention. There is no setting to change it either, it's locked away. I would understand if it was a privacy thing for some couples but it should be an option in her settings not locked away for everyone."
148,1,"Great for period tracking. Before pregnancy 5 star. Postpartum, more like a 1 star app. Now it seems the app is struggling. The calendar knows I was pregnant but does not take into account postpartum or breastfeeding. Just wish there was an option to put in breastfeeding and postpartum, so it's not constantly trying to tell me something is wrong with my cycle."
149,2,"It's nice to be able to track my period but instead of grabbing a pen and paper to do that I downloaded this because with how much is in the app I thought there would be more for free then just a period calendar. I expected understand and insights, and yet everything little thing I clicked on I had to pay for. The thing is, is that I would have paid for it if there was a bit more for free. This app wasn't created to help it was created for self purposes. nothing on here to help is for free."
150,3,"I've been using Flo for 5+ years, and it has been mostly great. Flo can predict my period often down to the day, and is helpful for tracking ovulation. Unfortunately in more recent years, they have progressively gotten rid of a lot of the free features that used to be included (such as evaluation chats, and articles), that now you have to pay for premium to use. It feels like everything that would be helpful to use to learn more about your cycle, they want you to have premium to access."
151,2,I wanna give it more stars become it is the best when it comes to tracking and getting tips and tricks for anything but I'm saying two stars because you only have access to like two things unless you pay. it's ridiculously expensive. why the heck do we have to pay for a pregnancy tracker or a health tracker in general. if we need the help and guidance it should be free our health shouldn't come with a cost. it's literally useless app without premium. please do something I loved this app
152,3,"I used to really like the app because for the free verison, yoi still got some knowledge about things you log or when you're pregnant, really helpful info about the baby as it grows. I got a new phone and couldn't access my account wasn't a big deal, bc I just made a new one, but now I cant acces I was able b4 other than logging my symptoms or settings. I can't look pretty much anything on the app bc it just puts me on page to buy the premium option. Im even locked out from the calendar."
153,3,"overall balanced app. 1 big nit pick is how you enter your weight. maybe some find having to spin and spin the weight wheele pleasing, I do not. if you could just tap and enter it like most other apps I would be more inclined to increase the rating. the other thing I noticed is that the overall design is simple but almost lacks in esthetic. back ground options, better/ more intricate designs. something of that nature would be awesome. these 2 things would add a star each in my opinion."
154,2,"it used to be a great app for tracking my period. once I paid for premium all it does is send me ads to renew which is so annoying. Whenever the app has a glitch and I have to reinstall it, it takes 15 mins to skip all of the questions,log back into my account. All of the information it had about pregnancy was inaccurate. The estimated sizes didn't match anything that I sourced from other sites, plus considering I was paying a premium for the feature the BUMP was free, accurate with 3D images."
155,4,"Overall great experience with this app. There are a few selections I'd love to see added. I had to stop birth control (after 16 years) for health reasons, and I wanted to keep track of my cycle as my body regulated, and so I could reduce my chances of getting pregnant, but that's not an option when asked why I got the app. I also use this as a mood/general well-being tracker, and noting how much quality sleep I got the night before would be super helpful to spot patterns there."
156,1,"This app is seriously one of those that are only out there for whatever they can get from whatever sucker is naive enough to sign up for my free trial. Most apps/companies have no problem refunding you- especially if it's within 5 minutes of being charged and reaching out to their customer service. They charged me at midnight, hoping I would not see, but I did. I find their services useless, that's why I deleted it a day after I downloaded it, I just forgot to cancel my subscription. üö´‚ùåüö´"
157,1,"I answered a million questions only to be told I had to pay a subscription for the data analysis. I declined and then got a message saying ""befire you start, we have a gift for you"". I clicked on it to find out that it was just a discounted yearly subscription. Even though I had not gotten a subscription, there was a box on my home page saying ""today's chance of pregnancy"" with a tick underneath but when I clicked, I was taken to the page of different subscriptions."
158,2,I had this app years ago and loved it so decided to download it again a couple of months ago. I'm disappointed in the amount of times I'm being asked to pay for a subscription. I used this app before with very minimal ads and there was no pressure to pay for premium. And now I can't escape the pop-ups multiple times just by opening the app I find myself just ignoring it and not actually using it because you're constantly being pushed to buy l.
159,1,dislike it. you have to subscribe and pay to view the simplest things on the app. not worth it unless you pay. the max you can do there is just tract your cycle. you can't use anything else mor read anything on there unless you pay. get another app that can help you and an app where you can do much more. this is not worth it. if you don't want to pay every month. and it's pretty expensive too when other apps offer so much more without paying.
160,1,"Edit 2025: my last review was complaining about the constant pop-ups and chats, that would only be useful if I paid for premium. I don't need them, anyway. Recently I got a new phone, and all of my tracking data for the last 2 years disappeared. So, I'm starting from scratch. I only need this to track my phases, which it can barely do, apparently. Will probably just transition to my Fitbit app exclusively, since it still has all my data from 2018 no problem."
161,1,"I've used the app for 9 years or so. App is only good for basic tracking unless you want to pay extra, I can do that on a paper calendar. The amount of stuff behind a pay wall is ridiculous and out of hand. I'm officially going to start looking for a different app. plus the data leaks? no thanks."
162,1,"I enjoyed using this app and it was always somewhat accurate but it kicked me out of my account for no reason. i switched phones and tried signing back in but it wont accept my email or password (which i know is correct) and when I tried to send reset instructions to my email, it won't send. this is all right after I finally caved and paid for the subscription. Now I can't even access the app."
163,1,"I have been apart of Flo since it's release and it's so sad to see the money grab app it's turned into today. Some of us use this app just to stay organized about the changes in our cycles, now you can't even open the app or navigate through it without a pop up begging for money. If I didn't only use it 5 days out of the month or didn't have 10 years worth of data stored I'd probably switch apps. Plus there's a whole class action lawsuit going on so that's fun!"
164,4,Great app! Very helpful! Just wish it weren't so pushy with premium. Everytime I go into the app it sends me a pop-up asking me to talk about how I feel because of that time. I try to ignore it but I really wish I could turn off those pop-ups. Other than that it's a solid period tracker. Even for my irregular cycles.
165,3,"I've used this app for 6+ years and I really loved it. unfortunately for the past year or two the app has been fairly glitchy for me. It no longer saves my logged periods to the point it's telling me I'm over a year late. it fails to predict cycle dates too. finally having to let this app go, which is sad as I've used it with all of my pregnancies."
166,2,"it was wonderful for years until now. the most essential features are officially only accessible via payment. tracking is useless to me now with all the information essentially being held hostage with a price point. five years ago, it was awesome. all the information was generally free. now with the most basic feature (fertility prediction and chances of conception) locked up and only being able to track *symptoms* I have grown to hate this once lovable and arguably essential tool."
167,2,"I used this app free for years and was happy with it's basic prediction functions, but recently I switched phones and all my data was lost. The login feature is totally broken and no matter which option I choose it takes me to an error page. I guess I won't miss the constant push for premium now that I've switched to a new app."
168,5,This app is great for tracking and predicting your period. I really like that you can change the focus based on your goals like getting pregnant or just simply tracking your cycle. I use the app all the time to plan trips. There are also some good articles and recommendations from professionals in the app. I would recommend this app.
169,3,this app could be awesome if there was a bit more inclusivity. I want to track my hormonal cycles while I have an IUD and there's no options without actively bleeding. there's also no entries for some of my regular symptoms and it is 99% centered around pregnancy and ovulation. theres a lot more to women's hormonal health and cycles and I would love to see an app like this that wasn't targeted at women trying to get pregnant or avoid getting pregnant.
170,3,"App is great for tracking moods, periods, and many other symptoms that helped me understand my body better. I had premium for a year or two and the advice didn't really change or was specifically tailored to me. I stopped premium and now when I click on content I'm not allowed to see anything, even though I thought some of it was basic health knowledge."
171,3,"I like Flo and have been using it for years. There's a few things that could be improved, though. #1, Paywall; having the insights behind a paywall is nonsense. Offer them as a one-time low-cost payment to have access if need be. #2, the constant pop-up to subscribe; this is beyond annoying. #3, no sign-in after a reinstall; having to go through that whole questionnaire process again is frustrating & time consuming. #4 Subscription cost; absolutely ridiculous for a period tracker app."
172,1,"worst tracking app. I'm so tired of getting asked for money. Especially when most of the ""advice"" or reasoning for things can be simply googled. Thought it would be convenient to have an app that has it all in one place, but paying for that is outrageous and comical. And usually I have no issue with apps that have a subscription, to each their own if they want to pay for a membership, don't care. But there is no touching anything on the app without the dang pop up to pay"
173,4,"update: had to re-login after getting a new phone and there needs to be an option to login before the long intro sequence. The intro should also just be fully skippable, and I could do without the ""long press"" to set my intentions. While I appreciate the personalization, forcing us to click through feels condescending. It's up to me why I use this app, that's the whole point. The process is enough to scare off new users as well. I've used flo for a long time, but these changes give me pause."
174,2,"it's fine for tracking periods, but it won't stop shoving a subscription in your face. It feels like every time you open the app, every time you click on something, read something, close something, it has to ask if you want to buy a subscription. It gets real annoying real fast. There are probably better tracker apps out there tbh."
175,2,"This app has a hard time with my irregular periods. When I log a period it doesn't always restart my cycle. Because of that, it often tells me to take pregnancy tests when I know I'm not pregnant. That chat bot conversations aren't very informative or personalized. I regret paying for the app for a year. I can see how it'd be useful for someone with more regular periods."
176,1,"I stopped paying for it when they started to give false biology. the app does nothing special other than track your pregnancy and period while looking pretty. other than that it prohibits the basic free information you can get from Google unless you pay for it to be shown on the app, there are several free apps that provide way more accurate information and articles without making a subscription. everything in the app is achievable for free."
177,4,"it's a very good tracker, and most of my periods have been right on track, I appreciate they allow a free trial, which is great, and I understand this can't be free but most things are restricted the only thing you can really do is track and chat with strangers but sometimes its not that helpful, Not everyone has money for it, and I think a simple solution is to allow at least 3 free articles, but this is just a recommendation."
178,2,"I believe the app would be really great If not for the constant asking to pay for the subscription. A reminder from time to time is fine, but it's a little overwhelming when it's done too much. A change in that direction would definitely make people more eager to actually consider the payment, while now it just gets annoying instead of encouraging."
179,1,"This app will let you open the app without creating an account. If you have to replace your phone or app is removed, you will never get your medical data back. The yrs of logging your data is just gone. If you remember info and want to back log, you can't. I'm very disappointed with how they can not pull up my account, even after sending proof of payment from my email. I'm pregnant right now and had important info in notes. Save your time and go somewhere else."
180,2,"It's advertised as one of the best ""free"" period tracking apps (which is why I downloaded), but every touchpoint is interrupted by a pay wall. It will waste your time with seemingly ""complimentary"" features only to hit you with the credit card request 20 questions in. Super annoying. would love a suggestion for an alternative. I think if you're trying to get pregnant it makes sense to pay, but it's annoying they advertise so much as a ""free"" platform when that tier is REALLY annoying to use"
181,4,"The app is great and really helped me understand my body and menstrual cycle better. One suggestion: please consider recording menstrual days based on the exact time it starts (e.g. 9 PM) instead of counting it as a full day. Also, it would be better if we get to track the amount of exercise, vaginal discharge, and sleep hours. These details can support a more personalized and effective women‚Äôs health routine. Keep up the great work!"
182,2,"I've had this app for a few years now, i love that it will tell me when my monthly is coming but I hate how it is constantly telling to sign up for a plan. Why give me the option to learn more about MY body but then turn around and put a price tage on it. 7.99 a month is crazy but 39.99 a year is too. Especially for a teenage girl who's just now learning everything. Like I want to learn more about me and my body without losing money."
183,5,love this app and the support team. I had an old email address I deleted that I had used to sign up for flo with and when I got a new phone I couldn't access my account!! fortunately however I'd used a different account to purchase premium with and support managed to merge the accounts so I could access my 2 years of data with!! they were so helpful and just lovely!!
184,2,"I've been using this app for about a decade now. It was the first app I downloaded to help me track my irregular periods. This app helped me communicate with my doctor and my partner better and helped me get insight into my body. At first, you could get information you could google for free now. You have to pay for the short articles or to be diagnosed. Every time I open the app, there is one less free feature."
185,2,Have been using this app for about two years or so. Used to be a really good app but now you cannot use most of the features without it pestering for you to buy their premium subscription. It seems that they have taken most of the insights and features away from the free download and want you to pay the subscription for them now.
186,2,"it's very good at tracking your period but the reason I downloaded the app, is locked behind a pay wall üòû. I wanted the advice features and how to deal with certain things as a teenager but you can't click on anything without it being included in the premium membership. I wish flo could make it more accessible for teens that most likely don't have money but still wants advice üòÖ"
187,1,"This app asks for preferences, whether you're in a relationship, sexually active, etc. and then promptly ignores all your preferences and shows you articles and notifications about the stuff you didn't ask for anyway. This, of course, is only after premium has been thrown in your face so many times you forget that this app even has a single free feature. Which it really doesn't, their chat bot can't finish a complete thought without pulling out the beggar routine. wouldn't recommend"
188,5,I originally wanted to use this so I could compare calendars with another app and I've only had it for like 2 days so far but I actually really love all the features. my Fianc√© is able to look at a lot more information than the other one I had and it asks a lot of questions. I'm about to find out if all the questions help with accurate information because this says my monthly is due tomorrow and my other one says a little under a week. I'll report back soon
189,5,"This app is truly amazing, had it since high school. I will give this app 5 stars if you guys added in the other forms of birth control that other women like myself have that might cause you not to have your period for a whole year or 2. I think that would be a game changer for you guys. Keep doing your thing ü§óüíï Edit: Nevermind, I just found those options in the app, 5 stars!!!"
190,2,"The app is pretty decent. I downloaded it just to track my period, so all the sex life and pregnancy tracking questions weren't the best thing to open the app to, and as a queer asexual person it was not very fun to be bombarded with all that. Especially since I'm fairly sure that all of those sex education were about straight sex. Which leads to my second critique of the app, without paying all the insights and articles are off limit. This app is pretty much just a period tracker with sex ads."
191,2,"This is a great app, with the major exception that this app really pushes the monthly or yearly subscription at every possible opportunity. If you don't want or can't afford the subscription, it's a real pain. I just want to track my cycle. It would be amazing if I could turn off the articles (most of which need a subscription to read). However, for tracking your period, this app is the best on the market (I've tried a fair number)."
192,4,"I've used this app for many years and love the prediction and analysis data and anonymous features. The bad is that while I understand the purpose of premium, I feel like it gets push way too frequently and caused me to use the app less (only for tracking). When they introduced the partner feature, it was so limited that my partner paid for the premium which then gave it to me. The partner feature is great but needs some work which I'll submit through their email."
193,1,"Used to be the best tracking app ever and I've been using it for the past 8-9 years. Unfortunately, it has been made clear that now they just care about money because half the things you used to be able to read/learn/do on the app now are hidden behind a paywall when they didn't use to be. Literally feel like I can't click anything without being told I need to have a subscription now. Finishing my pregnancy out with it just for tracking the weeks then switching to a different period tracker."
194,2,"if you're a free user this app is really annoying. they dont clearly state what is a premium feature, so you end up clicking on many things only to get a prompt to subscribe. I understand its a business and you need money. but all other apps show what's premium by using a star or crown icon on those features so you can make the decision for yourself if you want to click. this has given me a really negative view on the app even though the premium stuff looks really interesting bc I feel tricked"
195,4,"it's simple and I like the features they have, but almost all of them are behind a paywall except the symptoms tracker. don't expect much else from this app unless you plan on paying for it. And to be honest forcing people to pay for health education leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I'm not saying make the whole app free, but at least leave important/basic information available to everyone."
196,1,"EDIT:Still 1 ‚≠êÔ∏è.After being told there is a free version with a tracker & notifications, it took 5 tries to close out the subscription popup.I wasn't told all you can track is your period. I get notifications for other categories I expressed interest in, but can't access any w/o paying.Subscription popups are aggressive & constant.Free version should have access to most of the other features, even if limited to use, instead of forced to do a free trial.Bad way to gain customers.I hope it's fixed"
197,5,"One of the best period tracking apps. I have been using it for over a year or two and the predictions are so accurate, it's so helpful to know exactly what's going on with your body! The flo assistant insights are really helpful as well, the secret chat is a great feature too! Girl to girl conversations without the fear of judgement are so refreshing."
198,1,"I wanted to download a copy of my data. This is not an option in the app and you are required to contact the app support email. You only receive the same ""copy and paste"" AI generated responses via email from a 3rd party service when you attempt to contact their app support. Despite requesting a copy multiple times, Flo will not provide me with a full copy of my own period/fertility data!"
199,4,"overall very accurate. whether it be predicting how I'm going to feel or other things like that, it's very helpful. one thing I don't like is how you have to pay for half of the features. don't get me wrong, if a had the money I 100% would buy premium because it is definitely worth it, but I don't have the money so unfortunately I cant. Great app though, would recommend as a period tracked!"
200,3,"Have used this app for years. Over all I like it, easy to use/ view all the data you put in. Originally you had access to all of the extra information, slowly alot of it was blocked unless you paid. Now apart from your calander/ entering symptoms you can't view anything unless you pay and you get constant pop ups trying to get you to subscribe making 90% of the apps features redundant. Think i'll start hunting around for a new app now."
201,5,"For the most part great!! Love the app for so many reasons. The ""couples"" portion DEFINITELY needs work üò¨ Quiz answers are vague and limiting. ""none of the above"" or ""all of the above"" answers would be great. Even BETTER would be the option to type your own response, or ""choose all that apply"" options. Daily check ins for HER would also be beneficial. Daily check in answer options also need work and are very limiting. Developers!!! Help us!!!"
202,3,"The app is good, but costs too much. I bought it on sale for $20/yr; this is what I'd say it's worth, not the $60/yr they're asking for. I used it for my first pregnancy and it was informative enough. Helpful app once you get past the paywall. I'd buy it again for $20, but until then, it's useless because of the paywalls."
203,2,"I am so upset with the dark mode. I don't know who programmed it, or if anyone tested it before, but I can't see anything. Literally. The second you move to dark mode all the letters still stay white on a mostly white background. I now can't switch back to day mode or change theme, because I can't see where to click the button. It's a guessing game at this point It makes the app completely unusable. I am literally a few dead nerve endings away from deliting the app altogether"
204,5,"I have only been using Flo for a little while, but I have absolutely loved the experience. I think this app is really important and useful for girls, it helps them to understand their period and why their body may feel certain ways. it also gives you tips and tricks on beauty, and gets personal too. I think this app is amazing, especially because this is a good source to learn more about you and your periods."
205,5,Girl!! Tracking period Logging symptoms Get suggestions Keeping health logs Water tracking Partner linking You name it.... ‚≠êÔ∏è I have had this app for how long I don't remember. It has helped me keep my EVERYTHING on track since then. Definitely recommend it. But if it had more themes in black version I'd love that. ‚ú®Ô∏è. It feels like therapy when Logging in my periods üòÇ
206,3,"Pros: Best app for tracking period. It has many good features. and adding your (bf) partner is one such. cons: (needed improvement) - would be great if we can choose more symptoms like leg swelling, leg pain, chestache etc etc... - and need more discharge colors and textures... - It would be the best app ever if we include an option where our added partner can see about our symptoms, moods, and how heavy the flow is... (so atleast the üíö flag men will treat their gf better)"
207,4,"I love everything about this app. It's really accurate and it provides helpful tips and information. I wish the sync with google fit would work (sleep, period, weight) but for some reason at least for me it doesn't. It would also be very helpful if water intake and other stuff like that could be synced with apps like samsung health or health sync! Edit: A dark mode option would also be very helpful!"
208,2,"Money robbing!!! Hardly anything is free. Basically track your period, ovulation or pregnancy for free and everything else you need is behind a paywall Good app, great for tracking everything but I will say this app is terrible for the free option. You need more articles ect for free as not many people can afford the premium and some need the info but other than that, great app, very good with predictions!! I get you need to make some things money but not the whole app.. it's a joke"
209,5,"I have used flo for around 8 years or more I used it to get pregnant with my daughter(7) when my oldest son(10) was 2 even though I was in denial that I was even pregnant with her b/c with my son It took 10 years to get pregnant so this app does accurately predict the best day to concieve. It also has pregnancy mode and shows the growth of the baby, And now you can add your partner so they can see your fertility window, I 100% recommend , even if to just keep track of your cycle days."
210,4,"I absolutely love this app as it is quite accurate. 1 thing I can think of that they could do to improve the app is for it to allow u to add things to the symptoms, discharge, digestion and stool, mood, other and activity lists that it already gives u like my other app does which is actually awesome and helps make it easier to read and deal with as I instead have to add it to my notes üìù and Idk how accurately it adds those symptoms to my results."
211,3,It's an informative app but not as interactive for couples. I use it with my gf and all I get on my end is the ability to see her cycle days and ovulation windows. It would be nicer to have the ability to log her mood from my perspective if she wanted so she can get another person's input. That and other features to be logged by either person would be very useful in my opinion.
212,1,"I used to love this app. It used to provide information in the free version. I used to be able to customize it but it's just harsh white with pink text. Flo is just a glorified calendar. Tap literally any tab and it's behind a pay wall. Any topic at all. Pay wall. (And they really push the premium version in your face) It's actually frustrating. I used this app throughout my pregnancy but anything interesting I want to read, i have to pay for. It used to be convenient. I used to love Flo..."
213,3,"Very useful for recording symptoms from physical to emotional, but I can't in good conscience rate this app very high. When you record certain symptoms, the app will prompt a coded chat to assist, which is a good thing. The bad thing, however, is that many, many things are locked behind a premium plan, which is not clarified until you hit that point. It's really disheartening when the chats suggest an empathetic tone, then slip right into that ""try premium free!"" spiel."
214,2,"Bloated with repetitive and less than useful ""insights"" even on premium version. Chats seem to be full of bots making it tough to find relevant information. Not enough flexibility to deal with big changes to the cycle like PCOS. Basic tracking is algorithm based so works mostly ok if your body is consistent."
215,4,"overall the app is great, i just have a suggestion. while viewing weight chart, it shows the graph in intervals of a period cycle, it would be better if graph is continuous and not just divided into period cycles. a continuous graph will help us see how our weight is fluctuating not just for a period cycle but over time as well."
216,2,Flo is a great app. I transferred all my apps to my new phone and now it's not allowing me to get pass 'Choose your plan' all I'm seeing is reviews and it's frustrating that I can't get past it. I un-installed and reinstalled and I'm still having the same issue.
217,1,"It's been years and still no return of the dark themes that were removed and no new dark mode implemented, despite saying it would. Bit fed up of my retinas being singed every time I want to log a symptom or track my cycle. Edit: Not sure why dark mode is not available, it's 2024 almost every app has some form of dark mode implemented."
218,1,"Membership needed to access lots of content. Lots of features are presented to you but then locked by membership. Notification suggested its the best time to conceive yet first day of last period was 7 days ago? Which suggests the advice is very generic bordering on inaccurate. Too many features, notifications and membership pop ups that it's more hassle than it's worth to track my period."
219,1,"It's a very nice app. It worked well until I changed my device. After that, I haven't been able to access my account. I haven't been able to reach anyone from customer support. I paid for the year, so annoying. Update: Customer support finally reached out and there was no way to recover my info. The app is really nice, but it's unfortunate that something as common as changing a device will make you all the info you've been tracking."
220,5,"The app is designed perfectly for women. I've been using it for more than a year, and it helps me to track my irregular menstrual cycle. The prediction is quite accurate. So far, there's No better app than this one to help me gain the monthly insight about my own body. It's super easy to use, it definitely helpful for those who struggle with irregular menstrual cycle or those who want to get pregnant. Love this app so muchhh...."
221,4,"I love flo so much. It's been the only tracker to adapt to an irregular period cycle right away, which has been such a big help to me. I love all the chats with others going through similar things and I love that I'm able to share it all with my boyfriend on his phone. it makes our lives easier. however, I really wish it had a way to track how different birth controls are affecting you and track insertion dates for non pill options, and maybe a reminder when to book that Dr visit."
222,1,"Downloaded the app, only to be asked 3 million questions (some that had nothing to do with tracking ovulation), and then had to press some button on the screen for several seconds to ""commit"" to the app (super corny and annoying), only to then be told I had to pay yearly or monthly. The process is very tedious and frustrating. It doesn't matter what you click on on the app, if you haven't paid, you can't read anything. Frustrating and annoying experience. Uninstalling."
223,4,"Incredibly useful for tracking periods, as it adjusts to changes. I wish we could turn off, or skip parts of, the bot chat stuff. Its programming/information is too general and ultimately restrictive. I also would like more symptom options, even just an add your own that you can select again as needed. Thanks for the app!"
224,2,"I've had this app for about 5 years and really just used it to track my periods, which it is decent for. But over time, more and more features have been locked behind a paywall and I got very annoyed at the pop-ups telling me to buy a plan. The final straw was a bug that kept putting my symptoms on one day and my flow on the next, despite logging both on the same day. I just don't see the point in continuing to use an annoying and buggy app. I plan on tracking my periods on paper now."
225,1,"The only reason I still use this app is because it's been my tracking app for the last 8 years now. They keep taking away free features and making them only available with the paid subscription. I'm now pregnant again for the third time and now it won't even tell me anything other than how far along I am. Any insight it offers is no longer free! I have a feeling soon it won't even be free to use it at all. I would switch if it were easy to export my data into another app, but it's not."
226,2,"I loved this app, it was accurate and it allowed me to track my periods as well as my ovulation dates AND allowed me to monitor any abnormalities and as someone who has always had very irregular periods it was great. However now they want me to pay for all the things that made it great and I can no longer monitor for any issues like I used to without paying?! As women we are already nickel and dimed for items like pads and I might as well just go back to using a calendar if all I get is tracking"
227,2,"Some of the couples quizzes and information are kinda nice but as a period tracker couple sharing app it's terrible. She puts all her information in in detail and I get practically none of that information on my side even though that was our intention. There is no setting to change it either, it's locked away. I would understand if it was a privacy thing for some couples but it should be an option in her settings not locked away for everyone."
228,1,"Great for period tracking. Before pregnancy 5 star. Postpartum, more like a 1 star app. Now it seems the app is struggling. The calendar knows I was pregnant but does not take into account postpartum or breastfeeding. Just wish there was an option to put in breastfeeding and postpartum, so it's not constantly trying to tell me something is wrong with my cycle."
229,2,"It's nice to be able to track my period but instead of grabbing a pen and paper to do that I downloaded this because with how much is in the app I thought there would be more for free then just a period calendar. I expected understand and insights, and yet everything little thing I clicked on I had to pay for. The thing is, is that I would have paid for it if there was a bit more for free. This app wasn't created to help it was created for self purposes. nothing on here to help is for free."
230,3,"I've been using Flo for 5+ years, and it has been mostly great. Flo can predict my period often down to the day, and is helpful for tracking ovulation. Unfortunately in more recent years, they have progressively gotten rid of a lot of the free features that used to be included (such as evaluation chats, and articles), that now you have to pay for premium to use. It feels like everything that would be helpful to use to learn more about your cycle, they want you to have premium to access."
231,2,I wanna give it more stars become it is the best when it comes to tracking and getting tips and tricks for anything but I'm saying two stars because you only have access to like two things unless you pay. it's ridiculously expensive. why the heck do we have to pay for a pregnancy tracker or a health tracker in general. if we need the help and guidance it should be free our health shouldn't come with a cost. it's literally useless app without premium. please do something I loved this app
232,3,"I used to really like the app because for the free verison, yoi still got some knowledge about things you log or when you're pregnant, really helpful info about the baby as it grows. I got a new phone and couldn't access my account wasn't a big deal, bc I just made a new one, but now I cant acces I was able b4 other than logging my symptoms or settings. I can't look pretty much anything on the app bc it just puts me on page to buy the premium option. Im even locked out from the calendar."
233,3,"overall balanced app. 1 big nit pick is how you enter your weight. maybe some find having to spin and spin the weight wheele pleasing, I do not. if you could just tap and enter it like most other apps I would be more inclined to increase the rating. the other thing I noticed is that the overall design is simple but almost lacks in esthetic. back ground options, better/ more intricate designs. something of that nature would be awesome. these 2 things would add a star each in my opinion."
234,2,"it used to be a great app for tracking my period. once I paid for premium all it does is send me ads to renew which is so annoying. Whenever the app has a glitch and I have to reinstall it, it takes 15 mins to skip all of the questions,log back into my account. All of the information it had about pregnancy was inaccurate. The estimated sizes didn't match anything that I sourced from other sites, plus considering I was paying a premium for the feature the BUMP was free, accurate with 3D images."
235,4,"Overall great experience with this app. There are a few selections I'd love to see added. I had to stop birth control (after 16 years) for health reasons, and I wanted to keep track of my cycle as my body regulated, and so I could reduce my chances of getting pregnant, but that's not an option when asked why I got the app. I also use this as a mood/general well-being tracker, and noting how much quality sleep I got the night before would be super helpful to spot patterns there."
236,1,"This app is seriously one of those that are only out there for whatever they can get from whatever sucker is naive enough to sign up for my free trial. Most apps/companies have no problem refunding you- especially if it's within 5 minutes of being charged and reaching out to their customer service. They charged me at midnight, hoping I would not see, but I did. I find their services useless, that's why I deleted it a day after I downloaded it, I just forgot to cancel my subscription. üö´‚ùåüö´"
237,1,"I answered a million questions only to be told I had to pay a subscription for the data analysis. I declined and then got a message saying ""befire you start, we have a gift for you"". I clicked on it to find out that it was just a discounted yearly subscription. Even though I had not gotten a subscription, there was a box on my home page saying ""today's chance of pregnancy"" with a tick underneath but when I clicked, I was taken to the page of different subscriptions."
238,2,I had this app years ago and loved it so decided to download it again a couple of months ago. I'm disappointed in the amount of times I'm being asked to pay for a subscription. I used this app before with very minimal ads and there was no pressure to pay for premium. And now I can't escape the pop-ups multiple times just by opening the app I find myself just ignoring it and not actually using it because you're constantly being pushed to buy l.
239,1,dislike it. you have to subscribe and pay to view the simplest things on the app. not worth it unless you pay. the max you can do there is just tract your cycle. you can't use anything else mor read anything on there unless you pay. get another app that can help you and an app where you can do much more. this is not worth it. if you don't want to pay every month. and it's pretty expensive too when other apps offer so much more without paying.
240,1,"Edit 2025: my last review was complaining about the constant pop-ups and chats, that would only be useful if I paid for premium. I don't need them, anyway. Recently I got a new phone, and all of my tracking data for the last 2 years disappeared. So, I'm starting from scratch. I only need this to track my phases, which it can barely do, apparently. Will probably just transition to my Fitbit app exclusively, since it still has all my data from 2018 no problem."
241,1,"I've used the app for 9 years or so. App is only good for basic tracking unless you want to pay extra, I can do that on a paper calendar. The amount of stuff behind a pay wall is ridiculous and out of hand. I'm officially going to start looking for a different app. plus the data leaks? no thanks."
242,1,"I enjoyed using this app and it was always somewhat accurate but it kicked me out of my account for no reason. i switched phones and tried signing back in but it wont accept my email or password (which i know is correct) and when I tried to send reset instructions to my email, it won't send. this is all right after I finally caved and paid for the subscription. Now I can't even access the app."
243,1,"I have been apart of Flo since it's release and it's so sad to see the money grab app it's turned into today. Some of us use this app just to stay organized about the changes in our cycles, now you can't even open the app or navigate through it without a pop up begging for money. If I didn't only use it 5 days out of the month or didn't have 10 years worth of data stored I'd probably switch apps. Plus there's a whole class action lawsuit going on so that's fun!"
244,4,Great app! Very helpful! Just wish it weren't so pushy with premium. Everytime I go into the app it sends me a pop-up asking me to talk about how I feel because of that time. I try to ignore it but I really wish I could turn off those pop-ups. Other than that it's a solid period tracker. Even for my irregular cycles.
245,3,"I've used this app for 6+ years and I really loved it. unfortunately for the past year or two the app has been fairly glitchy for me. It no longer saves my logged periods to the point it's telling me I'm over a year late. it fails to predict cycle dates too. finally having to let this app go, which is sad as I've used it with all of my pregnancies."
246,2,"it was wonderful for years until now. the most essential features are officially only accessible via payment. tracking is useless to me now with all the information essentially being held hostage with a price point. five years ago, it was awesome. all the information was generally free. now with the most basic feature (fertility prediction and chances of conception) locked up and only being able to track *symptoms* I have grown to hate this once lovable and arguably essential tool."
247,2,"I used this app free for years and was happy with it's basic prediction functions, but recently I switched phones and all my data was lost. The login feature is totally broken and no matter which option I choose it takes me to an error page. I guess I won't miss the constant push for premium now that I've switched to a new app."
248,5,This app is great for tracking and predicting your period. I really like that you can change the focus based on your goals like getting pregnant or just simply tracking your cycle. I use the app all the time to plan trips. There are also some good articles and recommendations from professionals in the app. I would recommend this app.
249,3,this app could be awesome if there was a bit more inclusivity. I want to track my hormonal cycles while I have an IUD and there's no options without actively bleeding. there's also no entries for some of my regular symptoms and it is 99% centered around pregnancy and ovulation. theres a lot more to women's hormonal health and cycles and I would love to see an app like this that wasn't targeted at women trying to get pregnant or avoid getting pregnant.
250,3,"App is great for tracking moods, periods, and many other symptoms that helped me understand my body better. I had premium for a year or two and the advice didn't really change or was specifically tailored to me. I stopped premium and now when I click on content I'm not allowed to see anything, even though I thought some of it was basic health knowledge."
251,3,"I like Flo and have been using it for years. There's a few things that could be improved, though. #1, Paywall; having the insights behind a paywall is nonsense. Offer them as a one-time low-cost payment to have access if need be. #2, the constant pop-up to subscribe; this is beyond annoying. #3, no sign-in after a reinstall; having to go through that whole questionnaire process again is frustrating & time consuming. #4 Subscription cost; absolutely ridiculous for a period tracker app."
252,1,"worst tracking app. I'm so tired of getting asked for money. Especially when most of the ""advice"" or reasoning for things can be simply googled. Thought it would be convenient to have an app that has it all in one place, but paying for that is outrageous and comical. And usually I have no issue with apps that have a subscription, to each their own if they want to pay for a membership, don't care. But there is no touching anything on the app without the dang pop up to pay"
253,4,"update: had to re-login after getting a new phone and there needs to be an option to login before the long intro sequence. The intro should also just be fully skippable, and I could do without the ""long press"" to set my intentions. While I appreciate the personalization, forcing us to click through feels condescending. It's up to me why I use this app, that's the whole point. The process is enough to scare off new users as well. I've used flo for a long time, but these changes give me pause."
254,2,"it's fine for tracking periods, but it won't stop shoving a subscription in your face. It feels like every time you open the app, every time you click on something, read something, close something, it has to ask if you want to buy a subscription. It gets real annoying real fast. There are probably better tracker apps out there tbh."
255,2,"This app has a hard time with my irregular periods. When I log a period it doesn't always restart my cycle. Because of that, it often tells me to take pregnancy tests when I know I'm not pregnant. That chat bot conversations aren't very informative or personalized. I regret paying for the app for a year. I can see how it'd be useful for someone with more regular periods."
256,1,"I stopped paying for it when they started to give false biology. the app does nothing special other than track your pregnancy and period while looking pretty. other than that it prohibits the basic free information you can get from Google unless you pay for it to be shown on the app, there are several free apps that provide way more accurate information and articles without making a subscription. everything in the app is achievable for free."
257,4,"it's a very good tracker, and most of my periods have been right on track, I appreciate they allow a free trial, which is great, and I understand this can't be free but most things are restricted the only thing you can really do is track and chat with strangers but sometimes its not that helpful, Not everyone has money for it, and I think a simple solution is to allow at least 3 free articles, but this is just a recommendation."
258,2,"I believe the app would be really great If not for the constant asking to pay for the subscription. A reminder from time to time is fine, but it's a little overwhelming when it's done too much. A change in that direction would definitely make people more eager to actually consider the payment, while now it just gets annoying instead of encouraging."
259,1,"This app will let you open the app without creating an account. If you have to replace your phone or app is removed, you will never get your medical data back. The yrs of logging your data is just gone. If you remember info and want to back log, you can't. I'm very disappointed with how they can not pull up my account, even after sending proof of payment from my email. I'm pregnant right now and had important info in notes. Save your time and go somewhere else."
260,2,"It's advertised as one of the best ""free"" period tracking apps (which is why I downloaded), but every touchpoint is interrupted by a pay wall. It will waste your time with seemingly ""complimentary"" features only to hit you with the credit card request 20 questions in. Super annoying. would love a suggestion for an alternative. I think if you're trying to get pregnant it makes sense to pay, but it's annoying they advertise so much as a ""free"" platform when that tier is REALLY annoying to use"
261,4,"The app is great and really helped me understand my body and menstrual cycle better. One suggestion: please consider recording menstrual days based on the exact time it starts (e.g. 9 PM) instead of counting it as a full day. Also, it would be better if we get to track the amount of exercise, vaginal discharge, and sleep hours. These details can support a more personalized and effective women‚Äôs health routine. Keep up the great work!"
262,2,"I've had this app for a few years now, i love that it will tell me when my monthly is coming but I hate how it is constantly telling to sign up for a plan. Why give me the option to learn more about MY body but then turn around and put a price tage on it. 7.99 a month is crazy but 39.99 a year is too. Especially for a teenage girl who's just now learning everything. Like I want to learn more about me and my body without losing money."
263,5,love this app and the support team. I had an old email address I deleted that I had used to sign up for flo with and when I got a new phone I couldn't access my account!! fortunately however I'd used a different account to purchase premium with and support managed to merge the accounts so I could access my 2 years of data with!! they were so helpful and just lovely!!
264,2,"I've been using this app for about a decade now. It was the first app I downloaded to help me track my irregular periods. This app helped me communicate with my doctor and my partner better and helped me get insight into my body. At first, you could get information you could google for free now. You have to pay for the short articles or to be diagnosed. Every time I open the app, there is one less free feature."
265,2,Have been using this app for about two years or so. Used to be a really good app but now you cannot use most of the features without it pestering for you to buy their premium subscription. It seems that they have taken most of the insights and features away from the free download and want you to pay the subscription for them now.
266,2,"it's very good at tracking your period but the reason I downloaded the app, is locked behind a pay wall üòû. I wanted the advice features and how to deal with certain things as a teenager but you can't click on anything without it being included in the premium membership. I wish flo could make it more accessible for teens that most likely don't have money but still wants advice üòÖ"
267,1,"This app asks for preferences, whether you're in a relationship, sexually active, etc. and then promptly ignores all your preferences and shows you articles and notifications about the stuff you didn't ask for anyway. This, of course, is only after premium has been thrown in your face so many times you forget that this app even has a single free feature. Which it really doesn't, their chat bot can't finish a complete thought without pulling out the beggar routine. wouldn't recommend"
268,5,I originally wanted to use this so I could compare calendars with another app and I've only had it for like 2 days so far but I actually really love all the features. my Fianc√© is able to look at a lot more information than the other one I had and it asks a lot of questions. I'm about to find out if all the questions help with accurate information because this says my monthly is due tomorrow and my other one says a little under a week. I'll report back soon
269,5,"This app is truly amazing, had it since high school. I will give this app 5 stars if you guys added in the other forms of birth control that other women like myself have that might cause you not to have your period for a whole year or 2. I think that would be a game changer for you guys. Keep doing your thing ü§óüíï Edit: Nevermind, I just found those options in the app, 5 stars!!!"
270,2,"The app is pretty decent. I downloaded it just to track my period, so all the sex life and pregnancy tracking questions weren't the best thing to open the app to, and as a queer asexual person it was not very fun to be bombarded with all that. Especially since I'm fairly sure that all of those sex education were about straight sex. Which leads to my second critique of the app, without paying all the insights and articles are off limit. This app is pretty much just a period tracker with sex ads."
271,2,"This is a great app, with the major exception that this app really pushes the monthly or yearly subscription at every possible opportunity. If you don't want or can't afford the subscription, it's a real pain. I just want to track my cycle. It would be amazing if I could turn off the articles (most of which need a subscription to read). However, for tracking your period, this app is the best on the market (I've tried a fair number)."
272,4,"I've used this app for many years and love the prediction and analysis data and anonymous features. The bad is that while I understand the purpose of premium, I feel like it gets push way too frequently and caused me to use the app less (only for tracking). When they introduced the partner feature, it was so limited that my partner paid for the premium which then gave it to me. The partner feature is great but needs some work which I'll submit through their email."
273,1,"Used to be the best tracking app ever and I've been using it for the past 8-9 years. Unfortunately, it has been made clear that now they just care about money because half the things you used to be able to read/learn/do on the app now are hidden behind a paywall when they didn't use to be. Literally feel like I can't click anything without being told I need to have a subscription now. Finishing my pregnancy out with it just for tracking the weeks then switching to a different period tracker."
274,2,"if you're a free user this app is really annoying. they dont clearly state what is a premium feature, so you end up clicking on many things only to get a prompt to subscribe. I understand its a business and you need money. but all other apps show what's premium by using a star or crown icon on those features so you can make the decision for yourself if you want to click. this has given me a really negative view on the app even though the premium stuff looks really interesting bc I feel tricked"
275,4,"it's simple and I like the features they have, but almost all of them are behind a paywall except the symptoms tracker. don't expect much else from this app unless you plan on paying for it. And to be honest forcing people to pay for health education leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I'm not saying make the whole app free, but at least leave important/basic information available to everyone."
276,1,"EDIT:Still 1 ‚≠êÔ∏è.After being told there is a free version with a tracker & notifications, it took 5 tries to close out the subscription popup.I wasn't told all you can track is your period. I get notifications for other categories I expressed interest in, but can't access any w/o paying.Subscription popups are aggressive & constant.Free version should have access to most of the other features, even if limited to use, instead of forced to do a free trial.Bad way to gain customers.I hope it's fixed"
277,5,"One of the best period tracking apps. I have been using it for over a year or two and the predictions are so accurate, it's so helpful to know exactly what's going on with your body! The flo assistant insights are really helpful as well, the secret chat is a great feature too! Girl to girl conversations without the fear of judgement are so refreshing."
278,1,"I wanted to download a copy of my data. This is not an option in the app and you are required to contact the app support email. You only receive the same ""copy and paste"" AI generated responses via email from a 3rd party service when you attempt to contact their app support. Despite requesting a copy multiple times, Flo will not provide me with a full copy of my own period/fertility data!"
279,4,"overall very accurate. whether it be predicting how I'm going to feel or other things like that, it's very helpful. one thing I don't like is how you have to pay for half of the features. don't get me wrong, if a had the money I 100% would buy premium because it is definitely worth it, but I don't have the money so unfortunately I cant. Great app though, would recommend as a period tracked!"
280,3,"Have used this app for years. Over all I like it, easy to use/ view all the data you put in. Originally you had access to all of the extra information, slowly alot of it was blocked unless you paid. Now apart from your calander/ entering symptoms you can't view anything unless you pay and you get constant pop ups trying to get you to subscribe making 90% of the apps features redundant. Think i'll start hunting around for a new app now."
281,5,"For the most part great!! Love the app for so many reasons. The ""couples"" portion DEFINITELY needs work üò¨ Quiz answers are vague and limiting. ""none of the above"" or ""all of the above"" answers would be great. Even BETTER would be the option to type your own response, or ""choose all that apply"" options. Daily check ins for HER would also be beneficial. Daily check in answer options also need work and are very limiting. Developers!!! Help us!!!"
282,3,"The app is good, but costs too much. I bought it on sale for $20/yr; this is what I'd say it's worth, not the $60/yr they're asking for. I used it for my first pregnancy and it was informative enough. Helpful app once you get past the paywall. I'd buy it again for $20, but until then, it's useless because of the paywalls."
283,2,"I am so upset with the dark mode. I don't know who programmed it, or if anyone tested it before, but I can't see anything. Literally. The second you move to dark mode all the letters still stay white on a mostly white background. I now can't switch back to day mode or change theme, because I can't see where to click the button. It's a guessing game at this point It makes the app completely unusable. I am literally a few dead nerve endings away from deliting the app altogether"
284,5,"I have only been using Flo for a little while, but I have absolutely loved the experience. I think this app is really important and useful for girls, it helps them to understand their period and why their body may feel certain ways. it also gives you tips and tricks on beauty, and gets personal too. I think this app is amazing, especially because this is a good source to learn more about you and your periods."
285,5,Girl!! Tracking period Logging symptoms Get suggestions Keeping health logs Water tracking Partner linking You name it.... ‚≠êÔ∏è I have had this app for how long I don't remember. It has helped me keep my EVERYTHING on track since then. Definitely recommend it. But if it had more themes in black version I'd love that. ‚ú®Ô∏è. It feels like therapy when Logging in my periods üòÇ
286,3,"Pros: Best app for tracking period. It has many good features. and adding your (bf) partner is one such. cons: (needed improvement) - would be great if we can choose more symptoms like leg swelling, leg pain, chestache etc etc... - and need more discharge colors and textures... - It would be the best app ever if we include an option where our added partner can see about our symptoms, moods, and how heavy the flow is... (so atleast the üíö flag men will treat their gf better)"
287,4,"I love everything about this app. It's really accurate and it provides helpful tips and information. I wish the sync with google fit would work (sleep, period, weight) but for some reason at least for me it doesn't. It would also be very helpful if water intake and other stuff like that could be synced with apps like samsung health or health sync! Edit: A dark mode option would also be very helpful!"
288,2,"Money robbing!!! Hardly anything is free. Basically track your period, ovulation or pregnancy for free and everything else you need is behind a paywall Good app, great for tracking everything but I will say this app is terrible for the free option. You need more articles ect for free as not many people can afford the premium and some need the info but other than that, great app, very good with predictions!! I get you need to make some things money but not the whole app.. it's a joke"
289,5,"I have used flo for around 8 years or more I used it to get pregnant with my daughter(7) when my oldest son(10) was 2 even though I was in denial that I was even pregnant with her b/c with my son It took 10 years to get pregnant so this app does accurately predict the best day to concieve. It also has pregnancy mode and shows the growth of the baby, And now you can add your partner so they can see your fertility window, I 100% recommend , even if to just keep track of your cycle days."
290,4,"I absolutely love this app as it is quite accurate. 1 thing I can think of that they could do to improve the app is for it to allow u to add things to the symptoms, discharge, digestion and stool, mood, other and activity lists that it already gives u like my other app does which is actually awesome and helps make it easier to read and deal with as I instead have to add it to my notes üìù and Idk how accurately it adds those symptoms to my results."
291,3,It's an informative app but not as interactive for couples. I use it with my gf and all I get on my end is the ability to see her cycle days and ovulation windows. It would be nicer to have the ability to log her mood from my perspective if she wanted so she can get another person's input. That and other features to be logged by either person would be very useful in my opinion.
292,1,"I used to love this app. It used to provide information in the free version. I used to be able to customize it but it's just harsh white with pink text. Flo is just a glorified calendar. Tap literally any tab and it's behind a pay wall. Any topic at all. Pay wall. (And they really push the premium version in your face) It's actually frustrating. I used this app throughout my pregnancy but anything interesting I want to read, i have to pay for. It used to be convenient. I used to love Flo..."
293,3,"Very useful for recording symptoms from physical to emotional, but I can't in good conscience rate this app very high. When you record certain symptoms, the app will prompt a coded chat to assist, which is a good thing. The bad thing, however, is that many, many things are locked behind a premium plan, which is not clarified until you hit that point. It's really disheartening when the chats suggest an empathetic tone, then slip right into that ""try premium free!"" spiel."
294,2,"Bloated with repetitive and less than useful ""insights"" even on premium version. Chats seem to be full of bots making it tough to find relevant information. Not enough flexibility to deal with big changes to the cycle like PCOS. Basic tracking is algorithm based so works mostly ok if your body is consistent."
295,4,"overall the app is great, i just have a suggestion. while viewing weight chart, it shows the graph in intervals of a period cycle, it would be better if graph is continuous and not just divided into period cycles. a continuous graph will help us see how our weight is fluctuating not just for a period cycle but over time as well."
296,2,Flo is a great app. I transferred all my apps to my new phone and now it's not allowing me to get pass 'Choose your plan' all I'm seeing is reviews and it's frustrating that I can't get past it. I un-installed and reinstalled and I'm still having the same issue.
297,1,"It's been years and still no return of the dark themes that were removed and no new dark mode implemented, despite saying it would. Bit fed up of my retinas being singed every time I want to log a symptom or track my cycle. Edit: Not sure why dark mode is not available, it's 2024 almost every app has some form of dark mode implemented."
298,1,"Membership needed to access lots of content. Lots of features are presented to you but then locked by membership. Notification suggested its the best time to conceive yet first day of last period was 7 days ago? Which suggests the advice is very generic bordering on inaccurate. Too many features, notifications and membership pop ups that it's more hassle than it's worth to track my period."
299,1,"It's a very nice app. It worked well until I changed my device. After that, I haven't been able to access my account. I haven't been able to reach anyone from customer support. I paid for the year, so annoying. Update: Customer support finally reached out and there was no way to recover my info. The app is really nice, but it's unfortunate that something as common as changing a device will make you all the info you've been tracking."
300,5,"The app is designed perfectly for women. I've been using it for more than a year, and it helps me to track my irregular menstrual cycle. The prediction is quite accurate. So far, there's No better app than this one to help me gain the monthly insight about my own body. It's super easy to use, it definitely helpful for those who struggle with irregular menstrual cycle or those who want to get pregnant. Love this app so muchhh...."
301,2,"To who it may concern, Please come to my assistance. Earlier today I noticed I had been charged for a premium subscription and I don't remember authorising it. It doesn't show on my Google play, but my Flo account has now changed to premium. I have no order receipt, or record of the transaction on my Google account. Can you come to my assistance? This is expensive and I want to cancel the subscription, request a refund and go back to Flo basic. It's very frustrating trying to figure this out."
302,2,"Somewhat useful, I only use the free mode. The tracker is accurate for periods, Useless when you're pregnant. I get constant notifications which I can't turn off, most things that are recommended are locked behind a paywall. I can't change how far along I am so everything pushed at me is irrelevant and inaccessible. I'm so close to uninstalling purely because of the notification harassment."
303,4,"Have used the app for years and always paid for the premium account. I noticed the app changed my profile to track cycle and not get pregnant. When trying to change, the subscription goes up to ¬£44.99 instead of ¬£14.99 which it currently is. Also, I recently got the Oura ring which says it can connect to Flo. However it seems impossible. The instructions to connect don't match with the app and there is nowhere in Flo that mentions supporting apps."
304,1,"Free partner version is extremely simple, no added value rather than being able to track my partner's cycle on the calendar. The given advices are very superficial and doesn't align much. All that topped with extreme pushy approach on singing up for the paid version. Every time I open the app I have to skip to several ""stories"" about the paid verson to then open the app. Got access to anything in the app rather than the calendar and the ""advices"". Super limited n annoying! U guys can do better."
305,2,"The app itself is good. I like the functions and everything. The only problem is that whatever you click, it pops up that the function is only available with a subscription. Sometimes even if you don't click any paid function, ads still pop up. I realize the hard work etc. but it's starting to get really annoying and it's hard to use the app if everything is locked under a subscription, especially when the trial version is no longer available."
306,1,"Love the graphics, but that's about it. You literally can't use this app without subscribing to an overpriced plan. It's an obscene amount for what it does. Every pop-up and explanation is behind a subscription wall, and it doesn't even offer much more than a quick question to ChatGPT. For now I'll keep using the basic feature - tracking, but I wonder how long before even that is paid."
307,1,"Don't understand why people like it so much. SEVERAL times a day I get ridiculous notifications from this app telling me ""oh today you might feel like this!"" or ""expect to be more sad today"" among other things, and there isn't a single setting to be able to turn them off. I wanted a simple app that tracks my period and warns me a day or 2 in advance with notifications, but I can't turn off the notifications because then I will have no heads up about my period."
308,2,"I‚Äôve been a loyal user‚Äîpremium for four years and basic for more than five‚Äîand I used to love this app. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm now considering cancelling my premium subscription due to persistent bugs. I keep receiving notifications despite turning them off, and more importantly, the app no longer provides information about my cycle. With its core feature missing, it's hard to justify the subscription cost."
309,2,"Seems to be a great tracking app, but really not very LGBTIQA+ friendly. Usually I'm not one to mention this as I understand queer relationships are the minority, but this app could do so many small things to make it more inclusive. For example, just some slight terminology changes and the addition of a few more options in the daily tracking section would make a huge difference. Disappointing to have paid for an app which isn't built to be inclusive of my sexuality."
310,3,"Flo is a decent app and it is mostly accurate. Although accuracy is great, it is unbelievable that premium is the only way to learn additional important facts about my body. These simple features should be free, not $55.99 Canadian yearly. Even trying to understand possible period symptoms are under a premium plan. Honestly, if you are a person who wants to further educate yourself about womanly cycles, this app isn't the best option unless you would like to pay $55.99 a year or $10.99 a month."
311,1,"it's ok for tracking the cycle but first, it has a ton of unnecessary features, and second, any time I log out of the app, go log back it, I need to go THROW THE WHOLE VERY LONG ONBOARDING THAT YOU CAN'T SKIP. Wrote to support about it a couple years ago... they said it's skippable... some questions, yes, but why don't you just give registered users an option to log in directly??? and, to top this off, once I managed to log back in, my data wasn't even saved! Imma look for a new period tracker"
312,2,"I used Flo years ago, and recently came on to use it again to find that most of the app uses you are required to pay premium. The app prompts me to click on things, have daily discussions with assistance, and gives insights, all of which require premium. So I've flashed a bunch of things I can't use, totally put me off. I'd rather find an app that I can use the things shown to me without having to pay üôÉ"
313,1,"Keeps getting worse and worse with every update. Now it's really hard to see which cycle day it is and it just says ""period may start today"" for like 2 weeks. It also stopped predicting for next months!! I will check other similar apps and change. Shame after years of using Flo. Also super annoying how much it's pushing for paid subscription now. Nobody will pay for an app that keeps getting WORSE."
314,1,if I could rate it zero stars I would. I've never hated an app so much. firstly the free trial charges you before the trial period is up. secondly it constantly tells me my period is late and to do a pregnancy test. 1. it's not even close to being late and 2 I'm infertile. it's triggering as to see that notification constantly and not even be able to turn it off. As below I have emailed you awaiting a response.
315,1,"UI/UX has become so terrible for me, maybe for younger audience it's better this way but I'm always at a loss within the app. Exporting the data is overcomplicated as well so I ended up manually copying everything from several years to migrate. Would never use a service which doesn't have a clear export feature again, I don't feel like I own any data I have put in the app."
316,1,"It's so insane that they make everything so women positive, but if you want ANY useful features or ANY educational information you need premium. It's really so crazy. All you can do without premium is log the date, and for me the tracking isn't even accurate. The tracking is also manual not adapted to you personally. If you're gonna act so supportive, be so supportive."
317,1,"Annoying Because this app wipes your notes. now they added a feature that a couple days before your period it doesn't show likely ovulation dates after until you actually log your period. Which is very annoying because you cannot make tentative plans. It now adds two ""possible"" period dates to your estimated period and doesn't give you an option to leave it off. I left this app once before due to being inundated with ads and unsolicited pop ups about things I'm not interested in. Not coming back"
318,2,"You regularly give me some discount or 100 days streak ""gift"" but I am unable to open and see what is it. It keeps sending me on this page and nothing happens - it just opens Play store at you app and that's about it. That's annoying. And without payong there is literally no change even to put different email adress or anything it just bugs the whole phone if you try. I do have S24 ultra - it's quite fast for anything but this app when I try to get any of your gifts."
319,3,"I kinda like the app because it looks resourceful, been having it for 3 years now but I Uninstalled at a point because I couldn't find a use for it aside log period and read chats . like , what's the point of seeing resources and yet not being granted any access to them ? like, I really want to know if there's something you can READ or DO on Flo without necessarily paying for premium. Not everyone can pay for premium use of the app ,so at least quite a few stuff should be left accessible."
320,5,"One of the Best Period Tracking Apps! I've been using Flo for a while now, and it has truly made a difference in how I track and understand my cycle. The app is beautifully designed, easy to use, and extremely accurate with predictions. I love how it not only tracks periods and ovulation but also provides insightful articles, health tips, and reminders. It‚Äôs like having a mini health assistant in my pocket."
321,4,"I love flo so much. It's been the only tracker to adapt to an irregular period cycle right away, which has been such a big help to me. I love all the chats with others going through similar things and I love that I'm able to share it all with my boyfriend on his phone. it makes our lives easier. however, I really wish it had a way to track how different birth controls are affecting you and track insertion dates for non pill options, and maybe a reminder when to book that Dr visit."
322,1,"Downloaded the app, only to be asked 3 million questions (some that had nothing to do with tracking ovulation), and then had to press some button on the screen for several seconds to ""commit"" to the app (super corny and annoying), only to then be told I had to pay yearly or monthly. The process is very tedious and frustrating. It doesn't matter what you click on on the app, if you haven't paid, you can't read anything. Frustrating and annoying experience. Uninstalling."
323,4,"Incredibly useful for tracking periods, as it adjusts to changes. I wish we could turn off, or skip parts of, the bot chat stuff. Its programming/information is too general and ultimately restrictive. I also would like more symptom options, even just an add your own that you can select again as needed. Thanks for the app!"
324,2,"I've had this app for about 5 years and really just used it to track my periods, which it is decent for. But over time, more and more features have been locked behind a paywall and I got very annoyed at the pop-ups telling me to buy a plan. The final straw was a bug that kept putting my symptoms on one day and my flow on the next, despite logging both on the same day. I just don't see the point in continuing to use an annoying and buggy app. I plan on tracking my periods on paper now."
325,1,"The only reason I still use this app is because it's been my tracking app for the last 8 years now. They keep taking away free features and making them only available with the paid subscription. I'm now pregnant again for the third time and now it won't even tell me anything other than how far along I am. Any insight it offers is no longer free! I have a feeling soon it won't even be free to use it at all. I would switch if it were easy to export my data into another app, but it's not."
326,2,"I loved this app, it was accurate and it allowed me to track my periods as well as my ovulation dates AND allowed me to monitor any abnormalities and as someone who has always had very irregular periods it was great. However now they want me to pay for all the things that made it great and I can no longer monitor for any issues like I used to without paying?! As women we are already nickel and dimed for items like pads and I might as well just go back to using a calendar if all I get is tracking"
327,2,"Some of the couples quizzes and information are kinda nice but as a period tracker couple sharing app it's terrible. She puts all her information in in detail and I get practically none of that information on my side even though that was our intention. There is no setting to change it either, it's locked away. I would understand if it was a privacy thing for some couples but it should be an option in her settings not locked away for everyone."
328,1,"Great for period tracking. Before pregnancy 5 star. Postpartum, more like a 1 star app. Now it seems the app is struggling. The calendar knows I was pregnant but does not take into account postpartum or breastfeeding. Just wish there was an option to put in breastfeeding and postpartum, so it's not constantly trying to tell me something is wrong with my cycle."
329,2,"It's nice to be able to track my period but instead of grabbing a pen and paper to do that I downloaded this because with how much is in the app I thought there would be more for free then just a period calendar. I expected understand and insights, and yet everything little thing I clicked on I had to pay for. The thing is, is that I would have paid for it if there was a bit more for free. This app wasn't created to help it was created for self purposes. nothing on here to help is for free."
330,3,"I've been using Flo for 5+ years, and it has been mostly great. Flo can predict my period often down to the day, and is helpful for tracking ovulation. Unfortunately in more recent years, they have progressively gotten rid of a lot of the free features that used to be included (such as evaluation chats, and articles), that now you have to pay for premium to use. It feels like everything that would be helpful to use to learn more about your cycle, they want you to have premium to access."
331,2,I wanna give it more stars become it is the best when it comes to tracking and getting tips and tricks for anything but I'm saying two stars because you only have access to like two things unless you pay. it's ridiculously expensive. why the heck do we have to pay for a pregnancy tracker or a health tracker in general. if we need the help and guidance it should be free our health shouldn't come with a cost. it's literally useless app without premium. please do something I loved this app
332,3,"I used to really like the app because for the free verison, yoi still got some knowledge about things you log or when you're pregnant, really helpful info about the baby as it grows. I got a new phone and couldn't access my account wasn't a big deal, bc I just made a new one, but now I cant acces I was able b4 other than logging my symptoms or settings. I can't look pretty much anything on the app bc it just puts me on page to buy the premium option. Im even locked out from the calendar."
333,3,"overall balanced app. 1 big nit pick is how you enter your weight. maybe some find having to spin and spin the weight wheele pleasing, I do not. if you could just tap and enter it like most other apps I would be more inclined to increase the rating. the other thing I noticed is that the overall design is simple but almost lacks in esthetic. back ground options, better/ more intricate designs. something of that nature would be awesome. these 2 things would add a star each in my opinion."
334,2,"it used to be a great app for tracking my period. once I paid for premium all it does is send me ads to renew which is so annoying. Whenever the app has a glitch and I have to reinstall it, it takes 15 mins to skip all of the questions,log back into my account. All of the information it had about pregnancy was inaccurate. The estimated sizes didn't match anything that I sourced from other sites, plus considering I was paying a premium for the feature the BUMP was free, accurate with 3D images."
335,4,"Overall great experience with this app. There are a few selections I'd love to see added. I had to stop birth control (after 16 years) for health reasons, and I wanted to keep track of my cycle as my body regulated, and so I could reduce my chances of getting pregnant, but that's not an option when asked why I got the app. I also use this as a mood/general well-being tracker, and noting how much quality sleep I got the night before would be super helpful to spot patterns there."
336,1,"This app is seriously one of those that are only out there for whatever they can get from whatever sucker is naive enough to sign up for my free trial. Most apps/companies have no problem refunding you- especially if it's within 5 minutes of being charged and reaching out to their customer service. They charged me at midnight, hoping I would not see, but I did. I find their services useless, that's why I deleted it a day after I downloaded it, I just forgot to cancel my subscription. üö´‚ùåüö´"
337,1,"I answered a million questions only to be told I had to pay a subscription for the data analysis. I declined and then got a message saying ""befire you start, we have a gift for you"". I clicked on it to find out that it was just a discounted yearly subscription. Even though I had not gotten a subscription, there was a box on my home page saying ""today's chance of pregnancy"" with a tick underneath but when I clicked, I was taken to the page of different subscriptions."
338,2,I had this app years ago and loved it so decided to download it again a couple of months ago. I'm disappointed in the amount of times I'm being asked to pay for a subscription. I used this app before with very minimal ads and there was no pressure to pay for premium. And now I can't escape the pop-ups multiple times just by opening the app I find myself just ignoring it and not actually using it because you're constantly being pushed to buy l.
339,1,dislike it. you have to subscribe and pay to view the simplest things on the app. not worth it unless you pay. the max you can do there is just tract your cycle. you can't use anything else mor read anything on there unless you pay. get another app that can help you and an app where you can do much more. this is not worth it. if you don't want to pay every month. and it's pretty expensive too when other apps offer so much more without paying.
340,1,"Edit 2025: my last review was complaining about the constant pop-ups and chats, that would only be useful if I paid for premium. I don't need them, anyway. Recently I got a new phone, and all of my tracking data for the last 2 years disappeared. So, I'm starting from scratch. I only need this to track my phases, which it can barely do, apparently. Will probably just transition to my Fitbit app exclusively, since it still has all my data from 2018 no problem."
341,1,"I've used the app for 9 years or so. App is only good for basic tracking unless you want to pay extra, I can do that on a paper calendar. The amount of stuff behind a pay wall is ridiculous and out of hand. I'm officially going to start looking for a different app. plus the data leaks? no thanks."
342,1,"I enjoyed using this app and it was always somewhat accurate but it kicked me out of my account for no reason. i switched phones and tried signing back in but it wont accept my email or password (which i know is correct) and when I tried to send reset instructions to my email, it won't send. this is all right after I finally caved and paid for the subscription. Now I can't even access the app."
343,1,"I have been apart of Flo since it's release and it's so sad to see the money grab app it's turned into today. Some of us use this app just to stay organized about the changes in our cycles, now you can't even open the app or navigate through it without a pop up begging for money. If I didn't only use it 5 days out of the month or didn't have 10 years worth of data stored I'd probably switch apps. Plus there's a whole class action lawsuit going on so that's fun!"
344,4,Great app! Very helpful! Just wish it weren't so pushy with premium. Everytime I go into the app it sends me a pop-up asking me to talk about how I feel because of that time. I try to ignore it but I really wish I could turn off those pop-ups. Other than that it's a solid period tracker. Even for my irregular cycles.
345,3,"I've used this app for 6+ years and I really loved it. unfortunately for the past year or two the app has been fairly glitchy for me. It no longer saves my logged periods to the point it's telling me I'm over a year late. it fails to predict cycle dates too. finally having to let this app go, which is sad as I've used it with all of my pregnancies."
346,2,"it was wonderful for years until now. the most essential features are officially only accessible via payment. tracking is useless to me now with all the information essentially being held hostage with a price point. five years ago, it was awesome. all the information was generally free. now with the most basic feature (fertility prediction and chances of conception) locked up and only being able to track *symptoms* I have grown to hate this once lovable and arguably essential tool."
347,2,"I used this app free for years and was happy with it's basic prediction functions, but recently I switched phones and all my data was lost. The login feature is totally broken and no matter which option I choose it takes me to an error page. I guess I won't miss the constant push for premium now that I've switched to a new app."
348,5,This app is great for tracking and predicting your period. I really like that you can change the focus based on your goals like getting pregnant or just simply tracking your cycle. I use the app all the time to plan trips. There are also some good articles and recommendations from professionals in the app. I would recommend this app.
349,3,this app could be awesome if there was a bit more inclusivity. I want to track my hormonal cycles while I have an IUD and there's no options without actively bleeding. there's also no entries for some of my regular symptoms and it is 99% centered around pregnancy and ovulation. theres a lot more to women's hormonal health and cycles and I would love to see an app like this that wasn't targeted at women trying to get pregnant or avoid getting pregnant.
350,3,"App is great for tracking moods, periods, and many other symptoms that helped me understand my body better. I had premium for a year or two and the advice didn't really change or was specifically tailored to me. I stopped premium and now when I click on content I'm not allowed to see anything, even though I thought some of it was basic health knowledge."
351,3,"I like Flo and have been using it for years. There's a few things that could be improved, though. #1, Paywall; having the insights behind a paywall is nonsense. Offer them as a one-time low-cost payment to have access if need be. #2, the constant pop-up to subscribe; this is beyond annoying. #3, no sign-in after a reinstall; having to go through that whole questionnaire process again is frustrating & time consuming. #4 Subscription cost; absolutely ridiculous for a period tracker app."
352,1,"worst tracking app. I'm so tired of getting asked for money. Especially when most of the ""advice"" or reasoning for things can be simply googled. Thought it would be convenient to have an app that has it all in one place, but paying for that is outrageous and comical. And usually I have no issue with apps that have a subscription, to each their own if they want to pay for a membership, don't care. But there is no touching anything on the app without the dang pop up to pay"
353,4,"update: had to re-login after getting a new phone and there needs to be an option to login before the long intro sequence. The intro should also just be fully skippable, and I could do without the ""long press"" to set my intentions. While I appreciate the personalization, forcing us to click through feels condescending. It's up to me why I use this app, that's the whole point. The process is enough to scare off new users as well. I've used flo for a long time, but these changes give me pause."
354,2,"it's fine for tracking periods, but it won't stop shoving a subscription in your face. It feels like every time you open the app, every time you click on something, read something, close something, it has to ask if you want to buy a subscription. It gets real annoying real fast. There are probably better tracker apps out there tbh."
355,2,"This app has a hard time with my irregular periods. When I log a period it doesn't always restart my cycle. Because of that, it often tells me to take pregnancy tests when I know I'm not pregnant. That chat bot conversations aren't very informative or personalized. I regret paying for the app for a year. I can see how it'd be useful for someone with more regular periods."
356,1,"I stopped paying for it when they started to give false biology. the app does nothing special other than track your pregnancy and period while looking pretty. other than that it prohibits the basic free information you can get from Google unless you pay for it to be shown on the app, there are several free apps that provide way more accurate information and articles without making a subscription. everything in the app is achievable for free."
357,4,"it's a very good tracker, and most of my periods have been right on track, I appreciate they allow a free trial, which is great, and I understand this can't be free but most things are restricted the only thing you can really do is track and chat with strangers but sometimes its not that helpful, Not everyone has money for it, and I think a simple solution is to allow at least 3 free articles, but this is just a recommendation."
358,2,"I believe the app would be really great If not for the constant asking to pay for the subscription. A reminder from time to time is fine, but it's a little overwhelming when it's done too much. A change in that direction would definitely make people more eager to actually consider the payment, while now it just gets annoying instead of encouraging."
359,1,"This app will let you open the app without creating an account. If you have to replace your phone or app is removed, you will never get your medical data back. The yrs of logging your data is just gone. If you remember info and want to back log, you can't. I'm very disappointed with how they can not pull up my account, even after sending proof of payment from my email. I'm pregnant right now and had important info in notes. Save your time and go somewhere else."
360,2,"It's advertised as one of the best ""free"" period tracking apps (which is why I downloaded), but every touchpoint is interrupted by a pay wall. It will waste your time with seemingly ""complimentary"" features only to hit you with the credit card request 20 questions in. Super annoying. would love a suggestion for an alternative. I think if you're trying to get pregnant it makes sense to pay, but it's annoying they advertise so much as a ""free"" platform when that tier is REALLY annoying to use"
361,4,"The app is great and really helped me understand my body and menstrual cycle better. One suggestion: please consider recording menstrual days based on the exact time it starts (e.g. 9 PM) instead of counting it as a full day. Also, it would be better if we get to track the amount of exercise, vaginal discharge, and sleep hours. These details can support a more personalized and effective women‚Äôs health routine. Keep up the great work!"
362,2,"I've had this app for a few years now, i love that it will tell me when my monthly is coming but I hate how it is constantly telling to sign up for a plan. Why give me the option to learn more about MY body but then turn around and put a price tage on it. 7.99 a month is crazy but 39.99 a year is too. Especially for a teenage girl who's just now learning everything. Like I want to learn more about me and my body without losing money."
363,5,love this app and the support team. I had an old email address I deleted that I had used to sign up for flo with and when I got a new phone I couldn't access my account!! fortunately however I'd used a different account to purchase premium with and support managed to merge the accounts so I could access my 2 years of data with!! they were so helpful and just lovely!!
364,2,"I've been using this app for about a decade now. It was the first app I downloaded to help me track my irregular periods. This app helped me communicate with my doctor and my partner better and helped me get insight into my body. At first, you could get information you could google for free now. You have to pay for the short articles or to be diagnosed. Every time I open the app, there is one less free feature."
365,2,Have been using this app for about two years or so. Used to be a really good app but now you cannot use most of the features without it pestering for you to buy their premium subscription. It seems that they have taken most of the insights and features away from the free download and want you to pay the subscription for them now.
366,2,"it's very good at tracking your period but the reason I downloaded the app, is locked behind a pay wall üòû. I wanted the advice features and how to deal with certain things as a teenager but you can't click on anything without it being included in the premium membership. I wish flo could make it more accessible for teens that most likely don't have money but still wants advice üòÖ"
367,1,"This app asks for preferences, whether you're in a relationship, sexually active, etc. and then promptly ignores all your preferences and shows you articles and notifications about the stuff you didn't ask for anyway. This, of course, is only after premium has been thrown in your face so many times you forget that this app even has a single free feature. Which it really doesn't, their chat bot can't finish a complete thought without pulling out the beggar routine. wouldn't recommend"
368,5,I originally wanted to use this so I could compare calendars with another app and I've only had it for like 2 days so far but I actually really love all the features. my Fianc√© is able to look at a lot more information than the other one I had and it asks a lot of questions. I'm about to find out if all the questions help with accurate information because this says my monthly is due tomorrow and my other one says a little under a week. I'll report back soon
369,5,"This app is truly amazing, had it since high school. I will give this app 5 stars if you guys added in the other forms of birth control that other women like myself have that might cause you not to have your period for a whole year or 2. I think that would be a game changer for you guys. Keep doing your thing ü§óüíï Edit: Nevermind, I just found those options in the app, 5 stars!!!"
370,2,"The app is pretty decent. I downloaded it just to track my period, so all the sex life and pregnancy tracking questions weren't the best thing to open the app to, and as a queer asexual person it was not very fun to be bombarded with all that. Especially since I'm fairly sure that all of those sex education were about straight sex. Which leads to my second critique of the app, without paying all the insights and articles are off limit. This app is pretty much just a period tracker with sex ads."
371,2,"This is a great app, with the major exception that this app really pushes the monthly or yearly subscription at every possible opportunity. If you don't want or can't afford the subscription, it's a real pain. I just want to track my cycle. It would be amazing if I could turn off the articles (most of which need a subscription to read). However, for tracking your period, this app is the best on the market (I've tried a fair number)."
372,4,"I've used this app for many years and love the prediction and analysis data and anonymous features. The bad is that while I understand the purpose of premium, I feel like it gets push way too frequently and caused me to use the app less (only for tracking). When they introduced the partner feature, it was so limited that my partner paid for the premium which then gave it to me. The partner feature is great but needs some work which I'll submit through their email."
373,1,"Used to be the best tracking app ever and I've been using it for the past 8-9 years. Unfortunately, it has been made clear that now they just care about money because half the things you used to be able to read/learn/do on the app now are hidden behind a paywall when they didn't use to be. Literally feel like I can't click anything without being told I need to have a subscription now. Finishing my pregnancy out with it just for tracking the weeks then switching to a different period tracker."
374,2,"if you're a free user this app is really annoying. they dont clearly state what is a premium feature, so you end up clicking on many things only to get a prompt to subscribe. I understand its a business and you need money. but all other apps show what's premium by using a star or crown icon on those features so you can make the decision for yourself if you want to click. this has given me a really negative view on the app even though the premium stuff looks really interesting bc I feel tricked"
375,4,"it's simple and I like the features they have, but almost all of them are behind a paywall except the symptoms tracker. don't expect much else from this app unless you plan on paying for it. And to be honest forcing people to pay for health education leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I'm not saying make the whole app free, but at least leave important/basic information available to everyone."
376,1,"EDIT:Still 1 ‚≠êÔ∏è.After being told there is a free version with a tracker & notifications, it took 5 tries to close out the subscription popup.I wasn't told all you can track is your period. I get notifications for other categories I expressed interest in, but can't access any w/o paying.Subscription popups are aggressive & constant.Free version should have access to most of the other features, even if limited to use, instead of forced to do a free trial.Bad way to gain customers.I hope it's fixed"
377,5,"One of the best period tracking apps. I have been using it for over a year or two and the predictions are so accurate, it's so helpful to know exactly what's going on with your body! The flo assistant insights are really helpful as well, the secret chat is a great feature too! Girl to girl conversations without the fear of judgement are so refreshing."
378,1,"I wanted to download a copy of my data. This is not an option in the app and you are required to contact the app support email. You only receive the same ""copy and paste"" AI generated responses via email from a 3rd party service when you attempt to contact their app support. Despite requesting a copy multiple times, Flo will not provide me with a full copy of my own period/fertility data!"
379,4,"overall very accurate. whether it be predicting how I'm going to feel or other things like that, it's very helpful. one thing I don't like is how you have to pay for half of the features. don't get me wrong, if a had the money I 100% would buy premium because it is definitely worth it, but I don't have the money so unfortunately I cant. Great app though, would recommend as a period tracked!"
380,3,"Have used this app for years. Over all I like it, easy to use/ view all the data you put in. Originally you had access to all of the extra information, slowly alot of it was blocked unless you paid. Now apart from your calander/ entering symptoms you can't view anything unless you pay and you get constant pop ups trying to get you to subscribe making 90% of the apps features redundant. Think i'll start hunting around for a new app now."
381,5,"For the most part great!! Love the app for so many reasons. The ""couples"" portion DEFINITELY needs work üò¨ Quiz answers are vague and limiting. ""none of the above"" or ""all of the above"" answers would be great. Even BETTER would be the option to type your own response, or ""choose all that apply"" options. Daily check ins for HER would also be beneficial. Daily check in answer options also need work and are very limiting. Developers!!! Help us!!!"
382,3,"The app is good, but costs too much. I bought it on sale for $20/yr; this is what I'd say it's worth, not the $60/yr they're asking for. I used it for my first pregnancy and it was informative enough. Helpful app once you get past the paywall. I'd buy it again for $20, but until then, it's useless because of the paywalls."
383,2,"I am so upset with the dark mode. I don't know who programmed it, or if anyone tested it before, but I can't see anything. Literally. The second you move to dark mode all the letters still stay white on a mostly white background. I now can't switch back to day mode or change theme, because I can't see where to click the button. It's a guessing game at this point It makes the app completely unusable. I am literally a few dead nerve endings away from deliting the app altogether"
384,5,"I have only been using Flo for a little while, but I have absolutely loved the experience. I think this app is really important and useful for girls, it helps them to understand their period and why their body may feel certain ways. it also gives you tips and tricks on beauty, and gets personal too. I think this app is amazing, especially because this is a good source to learn more about you and your periods."
385,5,Girl!! Tracking period Logging symptoms Get suggestions Keeping health logs Water tracking Partner linking You name it.... ‚≠êÔ∏è I have had this app for how long I don't remember. It has helped me keep my EVERYTHING on track since then. Definitely recommend it. But if it had more themes in black version I'd love that. ‚ú®Ô∏è. It feels like therapy when Logging in my periods üòÇ
386,3,"Pros: Best app for tracking period. It has many good features. and adding your (bf) partner is one such. cons: (needed improvement) - would be great if we can choose more symptoms like leg swelling, leg pain, chestache etc etc... - and need more discharge colors and textures... - It would be the best app ever if we include an option where our added partner can see about our symptoms, moods, and how heavy the flow is... (so atleast the üíö flag men will treat their gf better)"
387,4,"I love everything about this app. It's really accurate and it provides helpful tips and information. I wish the sync with google fit would work (sleep, period, weight) but for some reason at least for me it doesn't. It would also be very helpful if water intake and other stuff like that could be synced with apps like samsung health or health sync! Edit: A dark mode option would also be very helpful!"
388,2,"Money robbing!!! Hardly anything is free. Basically track your period, ovulation or pregnancy for free and everything else you need is behind a paywall Good app, great for tracking everything but I will say this app is terrible for the free option. You need more articles ect for free as not many people can afford the premium and some need the info but other than that, great app, very good with predictions!! I get you need to make some things money but not the whole app.. it's a joke"
389,5,"I have used flo for around 8 years or more I used it to get pregnant with my daughter(7) when my oldest son(10) was 2 even though I was in denial that I was even pregnant with her b/c with my son It took 10 years to get pregnant so this app does accurately predict the best day to concieve. It also has pregnancy mode and shows the growth of the baby, And now you can add your partner so they can see your fertility window, I 100% recommend , even if to just keep track of your cycle days."
390,4,"I absolutely love this app as it is quite accurate. 1 thing I can think of that they could do to improve the app is for it to allow u to add things to the symptoms, discharge, digestion and stool, mood, other and activity lists that it already gives u like my other app does which is actually awesome and helps make it easier to read and deal with as I instead have to add it to my notes üìù and Idk how accurately it adds those symptoms to my results."
391,3,It's an informative app but not as interactive for couples. I use it with my gf and all I get on my end is the ability to see her cycle days and ovulation windows. It would be nicer to have the ability to log her mood from my perspective if she wanted so she can get another person's input. That and other features to be logged by either person would be very useful in my opinion.
392,1,"I used to love this app. It used to provide information in the free version. I used to be able to customize it but it's just harsh white with pink text. Flo is just a glorified calendar. Tap literally any tab and it's behind a pay wall. Any topic at all. Pay wall. (And they really push the premium version in your face) It's actually frustrating. I used this app throughout my pregnancy but anything interesting I want to read, i have to pay for. It used to be convenient. I used to love Flo..."
393,3,"Very useful for recording symptoms from physical to emotional, but I can't in good conscience rate this app very high. When you record certain symptoms, the app will prompt a coded chat to assist, which is a good thing. The bad thing, however, is that many, many things are locked behind a premium plan, which is not clarified until you hit that point. It's really disheartening when the chats suggest an empathetic tone, then slip right into that ""try premium free!"" spiel."
394,2,"Bloated with repetitive and less than useful ""insights"" even on premium version. Chats seem to be full of bots making it tough to find relevant information. Not enough flexibility to deal with big changes to the cycle like PCOS. Basic tracking is algorithm based so works mostly ok if your body is consistent."
395,4,"overall the app is great, i just have a suggestion. while viewing weight chart, it shows the graph in intervals of a period cycle, it would be better if graph is continuous and not just divided into period cycles. a continuous graph will help us see how our weight is fluctuating not just for a period cycle but over time as well."
396,2,Flo is a great app. I transferred all my apps to my new phone and now it's not allowing me to get pass 'Choose your plan' all I'm seeing is reviews and it's frustrating that I can't get past it. I un-installed and reinstalled and I'm still having the same issue.
397,1,"It's been years and still no return of the dark themes that were removed and no new dark mode implemented, despite saying it would. Bit fed up of my retinas being singed every time I want to log a symptom or track my cycle. Edit: Not sure why dark mode is not available, it's 2024 almost every app has some form of dark mode implemented."
398,1,"Membership needed to access lots of content. Lots of features are presented to you but then locked by membership. Notification suggested its the best time to conceive yet first day of last period was 7 days ago? Which suggests the advice is very generic bordering on inaccurate. Too many features, notifications and membership pop ups that it's more hassle than it's worth to track my period."
399,1,"It's a very nice app. It worked well until I changed my device. After that, I haven't been able to access my account. I haven't been able to reach anyone from customer support. I paid for the year, so annoying. Update: Customer support finally reached out and there was no way to recover my info. The app is really nice, but it's unfortunate that something as common as changing a device will make you all the info you've been tracking."
400,5,"The app is designed perfectly for women. I've been using it for more than a year, and it helps me to track my irregular menstrual cycle. The prediction is quite accurate. So far, there's No better app than this one to help me gain the monthly insight about my own body. It's super easy to use, it definitely helpful for those who struggle with irregular menstrual cycle or those who want to get pregnant. Love this app so muchhh...."
401,2,"To who it may concern, Please come to my assistance. Earlier today I noticed I had been charged for a premium subscription and I don't remember authorising it. It doesn't show on my Google play, but my Flo account has now changed to premium. I have no order receipt, or record of the transaction on my Google account. Can you come to my assistance? This is expensive and I want to cancel the subscription, request a refund and go back to Flo basic. It's very frustrating trying to figure this out."
402,2,"Somewhat useful, I only use the free mode. The tracker is accurate for periods, Useless when you're pregnant. I get constant notifications which I can't turn off, most things that are recommended are locked behind a paywall. I can't change how far along I am so everything pushed at me is irrelevant and inaccessible. I'm so close to uninstalling purely because of the notification harassment."
403,4,"Have used the app for years and always paid for the premium account. I noticed the app changed my profile to track cycle and not get pregnant. When trying to change, the subscription goes up to ¬£44.99 instead of ¬£14.99 which it currently is. Also, I recently got the Oura ring which says it can connect to Flo. However it seems impossible. The instructions to connect don't match with the app and there is nowhere in Flo that mentions supporting apps."
404,1,"Free partner version is extremely simple, no added value rather than being able to track my partner's cycle on the calendar. The given advices are very superficial and doesn't align much. All that topped with extreme pushy approach on singing up for the paid version. Every time I open the app I have to skip to several ""stories"" about the paid verson to then open the app. Got access to anything in the app rather than the calendar and the ""advices"". Super limited n annoying! U guys can do better."
405,2,"The app itself is good. I like the functions and everything. The only problem is that whatever you click, it pops up that the function is only available with a subscription. Sometimes even if you don't click any paid function, ads still pop up. I realize the hard work etc. but it's starting to get really annoying and it's hard to use the app if everything is locked under a subscription, especially when the trial version is no longer available."
406,1,"Love the graphics, but that's about it. You literally can't use this app without subscribing to an overpriced plan. It's an obscene amount for what it does. Every pop-up and explanation is behind a subscription wall, and it doesn't even offer much more than a quick question to ChatGPT. For now I'll keep using the basic feature - tracking, but I wonder how long before even that is paid."
407,1,"Don't understand why people like it so much. SEVERAL times a day I get ridiculous notifications from this app telling me ""oh today you might feel like this!"" or ""expect to be more sad today"" among other things, and there isn't a single setting to be able to turn them off. I wanted a simple app that tracks my period and warns me a day or 2 in advance with notifications, but I can't turn off the notifications because then I will have no heads up about my period."
408,2,"I‚Äôve been a loyal user‚Äîpremium for four years and basic for more than five‚Äîand I used to love this app. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm now considering cancelling my premium subscription due to persistent bugs. I keep receiving notifications despite turning them off, and more importantly, the app no longer provides information about my cycle. With its core feature missing, it's hard to justify the subscription cost."
409,2,"Seems to be a great tracking app, but really not very LGBTIQA+ friendly. Usually I'm not one to mention this as I understand queer relationships are the minority, but this app could do so many small things to make it more inclusive. For example, just some slight terminology changes and the addition of a few more options in the daily tracking section would make a huge difference. Disappointing to have paid for an app which isn't built to be inclusive of my sexuality."
410,3,"Flo is a decent app and it is mostly accurate. Although accuracy is great, it is unbelievable that premium is the only way to learn additional important facts about my body. These simple features should be free, not $55.99 Canadian yearly. Even trying to understand possible period symptoms are under a premium plan. Honestly, if you are a person who wants to further educate yourself about womanly cycles, this app isn't the best option unless you would like to pay $55.99 a year or $10.99 a month."
411,1,"it's ok for tracking the cycle but first, it has a ton of unnecessary features, and second, any time I log out of the app, go log back it, I need to go THROW THE WHOLE VERY LONG ONBOARDING THAT YOU CAN'T SKIP. Wrote to support about it a couple years ago... they said it's skippable... some questions, yes, but why don't you just give registered users an option to log in directly??? and, to top this off, once I managed to log back in, my data wasn't even saved! Imma look for a new period tracker"
412,2,"I used Flo years ago, and recently came on to use it again to find that most of the app uses you are required to pay premium. The app prompts me to click on things, have daily discussions with assistance, and gives insights, all of which require premium. So I've flashed a bunch of things I can't use, totally put me off. I'd rather find an app that I can use the things shown to me without having to pay üôÉ"
413,1,"Keeps getting worse and worse with every update. Now it's really hard to see which cycle day it is and it just says ""period may start today"" for like 2 weeks. It also stopped predicting for next months!! I will check other similar apps and change. Shame after years of using Flo. Also super annoying how much it's pushing for paid subscription now. Nobody will pay for an app that keeps getting WORSE."
414,1,if I could rate it zero stars I would. I've never hated an app so much. firstly the free trial charges you before the trial period is up. secondly it constantly tells me my period is late and to do a pregnancy test. 1. it's not even close to being late and 2 I'm infertile. it's triggering as to see that notification constantly and not even be able to turn it off. As below I have emailed you awaiting a response.
415,1,"UI/UX has become so terrible for me, maybe for younger audience it's better this way but I'm always at a loss within the app. Exporting the data is overcomplicated as well so I ended up manually copying everything from several years to migrate. Would never use a service which doesn't have a clear export feature again, I don't feel like I own any data I have put in the app."
416,1,"It's so insane that they make everything so women positive, but if you want ANY useful features or ANY educational information you need premium. It's really so crazy. All you can do without premium is log the date, and for me the tracking isn't even accurate. The tracking is also manual not adapted to you personally. If you're gonna act so supportive, be so supportive."
417,1,"Annoying Because this app wipes your notes. now they added a feature that a couple days before your period it doesn't show likely ovulation dates after until you actually log your period. Which is very annoying because you cannot make tentative plans. It now adds two ""possible"" period dates to your estimated period and doesn't give you an option to leave it off. I left this app once before due to being inundated with ads and unsolicited pop ups about things I'm not interested in. Not coming back"
418,2,"You regularly give me some discount or 100 days streak ""gift"" but I am unable to open and see what is it. It keeps sending me on this page and nothing happens - it just opens Play store at you app and that's about it. That's annoying. And without payong there is literally no change even to put different email adress or anything it just bugs the whole phone if you try. I do have S24 ultra - it's quite fast for anything but this app when I try to get any of your gifts."
419,3,"I kinda like the app because it looks resourceful, been having it for 3 years now but I Uninstalled at a point because I couldn't find a use for it aside log period and read chats . like , what's the point of seeing resources and yet not being granted any access to them ? like, I really want to know if there's something you can READ or DO on Flo without necessarily paying for premium. Not everyone can pay for premium use of the app ,so at least quite a few stuff should be left accessible."
420,5,"One of the Best Period Tracking Apps! I've been using Flo for a while now, and it has truly made a difference in how I track and understand my cycle. The app is beautifully designed, easy to use, and extremely accurate with predictions. I love how it not only tracks periods and ovulation but also provides insightful articles, health tips, and reminders. It‚Äôs like having a mini health assistant in my pocket."
421,1,"Tried to pay for subscription as almost everything is behind a paywall but the verification page is faulty. Input fields for verification codes don't work, nothing comes up when trying to enter numerical data. App developers need to look into this as customers can't pay for subscriptions, surprised this was not caught through QA testing."
422,1,"It was a great app until I tried to cancel after having a baby and a hysterectomy. I've spent a year trying to figure it out and it turns out I had two subscriptions, they were charging me for both and I didn't want either. It feels like you have to click a 100 times to cancel and jump through flaming hoops of fire. And you are screwed of you forget your log in or switch from IPhone to android. An absolutely terrible experience and and expensive learning curve."
423,4,love all the info you get from it definitely worth it. the only thing I wish it had was a widget that tracks the days of your cycle like a count down to it. the only widget they have is to track the growth of your baby which is awesome but not all of us are pregnant. so now I have two period apps on my phone one with a widget that show the day of my cycle and when I'm ovulating and one with an insane amount of info one everything.
424,4,"very useful for your basic needs. only thing stopping me from 5 stars is that pretty much every single feature you need to have premium for. I don't mind that for some cos obviously they gotta make money somehow but I do wish a couple more features, particularly insights about my health could perhaps be part of the free package. still a very useful app though for tracking so definitely recommend for that"
425,1,"I am not ""active"" and it keeps giving me notifications trying to make me scared, for example, ""you're 2 days late! you're 5 days late! you're 7 days late!"" this is literally just a data farming app (it collects data so it knows when you're craving chocolate, then it shows you advertisements for chocolate) zero stars"
426,2,"used to use it just to track my cycle but honestly this is not a good app at all. way too many ads and advertisements of their own app ,in app - WHILE being subscribed to premium. you can't access your information offline either. the ""useful"" insight you get is 8th grade biology at best. probably better apps out there , definitely don't reccomend this one though. you're better off tracking on paper and a calendar. and the weird kinky sex forums are... questionable"
427,5,"The app is so good, BUT, since i can't upgrade to the premium version it becomes so annoying when they ask me to, like almost everything requires premium, there are apps that can do the free options in the app without nagging about the upgrade! Please give more freedom to the users of the free version. Thank you. Update: great app, thank you so much. Recommandation: I wish you can add changes in body temperature to the symptoms feature, because many women feel reallt cold or hot during period"
428,5,"Love this app! Very easy to use and the interface is easy to understand. I downloaded it for assistance in tracking my period and ovulation for family planning purposes. And now, with its help, I'm happily 17 weeks expecting as a first time mom ü•∞ So I've switched to its pregnancy tracker feature, which has also been helpful with tidbits of interesting information!"
429,5,"I was recommended Flo by a friend as I was having irregular periods after coming off contraception. After a few periods were logged the predictions have been pretty spot on, so I feel much more at ease knowing when my period will be. I really like this app and find it most useful!"
430,1,"re-download this app because i used to use it religiously, i switched over to samsung health when i got my new phone, but its just not the same, i re-downloaded & it charged me for a subscription the day i got it, when i never signed up for one, i just wanted the basic free version just too keep track of my body and my cycle.. $40 later !!!! i love the app itself. it's very accurate, but im very aggravated that this happened üò§"
431,5,"I recently started using the Flo app to track my periods and I‚Äôm really enjoying it so far! The app looks bright, friendly, and very easy to use. It lets me log my period dates, flow, moods, symptoms, and even daily feelings, which helps me understand my body better. Flo gives clear reminders for upcoming periods, fertile windows, and ovulation days, which is super helpful. There are lots of helpful health articles and tips related to women‚Äôs health and wellness."
432,2,"I am generally happy with this application and have been using it for years. the only reason I am giving it a low rating is in hopes that a developer can address an issue I gave recently been experiencing. The functionality that I ise daily is the contraceptive reminders, but as of late the reminders do not come everyday. they skip days at random which is extremely problematic"
433,3,"it's a great app for tracking my period, but also a total cash grab. I can't look at anything to learn or for advice without needing the premium feature. the app gives a bunch of free trials, but I feel like there should be more things you could be able to do without having to pay."
434,3,"Great app, but SO FREAKING BUSY. As soon as you open the app, the freaking Flo AI companion pops up every single time (I am not interested in this feature at all and cant find a way to turn it off), a million things try to update at once, and the entire interface is just TOO MUCH. Disorganized and chaotic. I really find this app incredibly frustrating to use and extremely overstimulating even when Im NOT having a menstrual-induced migraine. When I'm actually on my period, this app is unbearable."
435,3,"overall app does what I want it to do, let's me see my cycle so I can predict around when my period happens again. although I know subscriptions help keep the up running it is a bit weird to put stuff life ""finding out why your cycle is irregular"" behind it??? or information that can be very useful about periods behind that paywall."
436,5,"I really love this app and all the symptoms you can log to help you get to know your own cycle and what to expect. I have a request to add something to the symptoms if that's possible. It would be great for position of cervix (high/low) and firmness (soft/hard) to be added, as a lot of women track this whilst trying to conceive."
437,3,i gave this app a 5 star before because of the secret chats but recently they're not updating. i can see there are posts when i click on a tag but it's not showing up on my feed. my feed is filled with old posts like from 4 to 6 days ago. AND i don't think my own posts are being shown on others feed because i don't get any responses recently when i used to get so many instantly before. I've tried logging in and out and reinstalling but no use
438,1,I'm having issues logging back in since I got a new phone. When you put in my email which is registered the account I pay for it opened a new account. The new account does not include any of my saved information nor the subscription I pay for it. Can you please provide me with someone to contact in regard to how to fix this. In the meantime I'll be canceling my subscription. Signing in has been a pain and full of pop up after pop up after pop-up even once I do get to the login screen.
439,2,"It's a very misleading app. If you don't have premium (which I had, not worth it), it'll walk you through a ""conversation"" with an AI but when you get to the end of the conversation, it tells you that you need to pay to see the answers. If you just want to track your period, it's perfectly fine for that. But if you want to read articles or have questions about your period, just use google ladies. It's free and much quicker (and you don't have to have a painful conversation with an AI)."
440,5,I love this app & how it helps me keep track of my shark week every month but it is insane on how you have to pay for this app & it being so much is ridiculous for a tracker of my shark week when I can do so with a regular calendar & or my note & reminder on my cellphone... 20 something a month or more is just not a price range everyone can afford for this app & I think it should be free to a extent but still have the options of everything unless you wanted to upgrade .
441,4,"I love flo so much. It's been the only tracker to adapt to an irregular period cycle right away, which has been such a big help to me. I love all the chats with others going through similar things and I love that I'm able to share it all with my boyfriend on his phone. it makes our lives easier. however, I really wish it had a way to track how different birth controls are affecting you and track insertion dates for non pill options, and maybe a reminder when to book that Dr visit."
442,1,"Downloaded the app, only to be asked 3 million questions (some that had nothing to do with tracking ovulation), and then had to press some button on the screen for several seconds to ""commit"" to the app (super corny and annoying), only to then be told I had to pay yearly or monthly. The process is very tedious and frustrating. It doesn't matter what you click on on the app, if you haven't paid, you can't read anything. Frustrating and annoying experience. Uninstalling."
443,4,"Incredibly useful for tracking periods, as it adjusts to changes. I wish we could turn off, or skip parts of, the bot chat stuff. Its programming/information is too general and ultimately restrictive. I also would like more symptom options, even just an add your own that you can select again as needed. Thanks for the app!"
444,2,"I've had this app for about 5 years and really just used it to track my periods, which it is decent for. But over time, more and more features have been locked behind a paywall and I got very annoyed at the pop-ups telling me to buy a plan. The final straw was a bug that kept putting my symptoms on one day and my flow on the next, despite logging both on the same day. I just don't see the point in continuing to use an annoying and buggy app. I plan on tracking my periods on paper now."
445,1,"The only reason I still use this app is because it's been my tracking app for the last 8 years now. They keep taking away free features and making them only available with the paid subscription. I'm now pregnant again for the third time and now it won't even tell me anything other than how far along I am. Any insight it offers is no longer free! I have a feeling soon it won't even be free to use it at all. I would switch if it were easy to export my data into another app, but it's not."
446,2,"I loved this app, it was accurate and it allowed me to track my periods as well as my ovulation dates AND allowed me to monitor any abnormalities and as someone who has always had very irregular periods it was great. However now they want me to pay for all the things that made it great and I can no longer monitor for any issues like I used to without paying?! As women we are already nickel and dimed for items like pads and I might as well just go back to using a calendar if all I get is tracking"
447,2,"Some of the couples quizzes and information are kinda nice but as a period tracker couple sharing app it's terrible. She puts all her information in in detail and I get practically none of that information on my side even though that was our intention. There is no setting to change it either, it's locked away. I would understand if it was a privacy thing for some couples but it should be an option in her settings not locked away for everyone."
448,1,"Great for period tracking. Before pregnancy 5 star. Postpartum, more like a 1 star app. Now it seems the app is struggling. The calendar knows I was pregnant but does not take into account postpartum or breastfeeding. Just wish there was an option to put in breastfeeding and postpartum, so it's not constantly trying to tell me something is wrong with my cycle."
449,2,"It's nice to be able to track my period but instead of grabbing a pen and paper to do that I downloaded this because with how much is in the app I thought there would be more for free then just a period calendar. I expected understand and insights, and yet everything little thing I clicked on I had to pay for. The thing is, is that I would have paid for it if there was a bit more for free. This app wasn't created to help it was created for self purposes. nothing on here to help is for free."
450,3,"I've been using Flo for 5+ years, and it has been mostly great. Flo can predict my period often down to the day, and is helpful for tracking ovulation. Unfortunately in more recent years, they have progressively gotten rid of a lot of the free features that used to be included (such as evaluation chats, and articles), that now you have to pay for premium to use. It feels like everything that would be helpful to use to learn more about your cycle, they want you to have premium to access."
451,2,I wanna give it more stars become it is the best when it comes to tracking and getting tips and tricks for anything but I'm saying two stars because you only have access to like two things unless you pay. it's ridiculously expensive. why the heck do we have to pay for a pregnancy tracker or a health tracker in general. if we need the help and guidance it should be free our health shouldn't come with a cost. it's literally useless app without premium. please do something I loved this app
452,3,"I used to really like the app because for the free verison, yoi still got some knowledge about things you log or when you're pregnant, really helpful info about the baby as it grows. I got a new phone and couldn't access my account wasn't a big deal, bc I just made a new one, but now I cant acces I was able b4 other than logging my symptoms or settings. I can't look pretty much anything on the app bc it just puts me on page to buy the premium option. Im even locked out from the calendar."
453,3,"overall balanced app. 1 big nit pick is how you enter your weight. maybe some find having to spin and spin the weight wheele pleasing, I do not. if you could just tap and enter it like most other apps I would be more inclined to increase the rating. the other thing I noticed is that the overall design is simple but almost lacks in esthetic. back ground options, better/ more intricate designs. something of that nature would be awesome. these 2 things would add a star each in my opinion."
454,2,"it used to be a great app for tracking my period. once I paid for premium all it does is send me ads to renew which is so annoying. Whenever the app has a glitch and I have to reinstall it, it takes 15 mins to skip all of the questions,log back into my account. All of the information it had about pregnancy was inaccurate. The estimated sizes didn't match anything that I sourced from other sites, plus considering I was paying a premium for the feature the BUMP was free, accurate with 3D images."
455,4,"Overall great experience with this app. There are a few selections I'd love to see added. I had to stop birth control (after 16 years) for health reasons, and I wanted to keep track of my cycle as my body regulated, and so I could reduce my chances of getting pregnant, but that's not an option when asked why I got the app. I also use this as a mood/general well-being tracker, and noting how much quality sleep I got the night before would be super helpful to spot patterns there."
456,1,"This app is seriously one of those that are only out there for whatever they can get from whatever sucker is naive enough to sign up for my free trial. Most apps/companies have no problem refunding you- especially if it's within 5 minutes of being charged and reaching out to their customer service. They charged me at midnight, hoping I would not see, but I did. I find their services useless, that's why I deleted it a day after I downloaded it, I just forgot to cancel my subscription. üö´‚ùåüö´"
457,1,"I answered a million questions only to be told I had to pay a subscription for the data analysis. I declined and then got a message saying ""befire you start, we have a gift for you"". I clicked on it to find out that it was just a discounted yearly subscription. Even though I had not gotten a subscription, there was a box on my home page saying ""today's chance of pregnancy"" with a tick underneath but when I clicked, I was taken to the page of different subscriptions."
458,2,I had this app years ago and loved it so decided to download it again a couple of months ago. I'm disappointed in the amount of times I'm being asked to pay for a subscription. I used this app before with very minimal ads and there was no pressure to pay for premium. And now I can't escape the pop-ups multiple times just by opening the app I find myself just ignoring it and not actually using it because you're constantly being pushed to buy l.
459,1,dislike it. you have to subscribe and pay to view the simplest things on the app. not worth it unless you pay. the max you can do there is just tract your cycle. you can't use anything else mor read anything on there unless you pay. get another app that can help you and an app where you can do much more. this is not worth it. if you don't want to pay every month. and it's pretty expensive too when other apps offer so much more without paying.
460,1,"Edit 2025: my last review was complaining about the constant pop-ups and chats, that would only be useful if I paid for premium. I don't need them, anyway. Recently I got a new phone, and all of my tracking data for the last 2 years disappeared. So, I'm starting from scratch. I only need this to track my phases, which it can barely do, apparently. Will probably just transition to my Fitbit app exclusively, since it still has all my data from 2018 no problem."
461,1,"I've used the app for 9 years or so. App is only good for basic tracking unless you want to pay extra, I can do that on a paper calendar. The amount of stuff behind a pay wall is ridiculous and out of hand. I'm officially going to start looking for a different app. plus the data leaks? no thanks."
462,1,"I enjoyed using this app and it was always somewhat accurate but it kicked me out of my account for no reason. i switched phones and tried signing back in but it wont accept my email or password (which i know is correct) and when I tried to send reset instructions to my email, it won't send. this is all right after I finally caved and paid for the subscription. Now I can't even access the app."
463,1,"I have been apart of Flo since it's release and it's so sad to see the money grab app it's turned into today. Some of us use this app just to stay organized about the changes in our cycles, now you can't even open the app or navigate through it without a pop up begging for money. If I didn't only use it 5 days out of the month or didn't have 10 years worth of data stored I'd probably switch apps. Plus there's a whole class action lawsuit going on so that's fun!"
464,4,Great app! Very helpful! Just wish it weren't so pushy with premium. Everytime I go into the app it sends me a pop-up asking me to talk about how I feel because of that time. I try to ignore it but I really wish I could turn off those pop-ups. Other than that it's a solid period tracker. Even for my irregular cycles.
465,3,"I've used this app for 6+ years and I really loved it. unfortunately for the past year or two the app has been fairly glitchy for me. It no longer saves my logged periods to the point it's telling me I'm over a year late. it fails to predict cycle dates too. finally having to let this app go, which is sad as I've used it with all of my pregnancies."
466,2,"it was wonderful for years until now. the most essential features are officially only accessible via payment. tracking is useless to me now with all the information essentially being held hostage with a price point. five years ago, it was awesome. all the information was generally free. now with the most basic feature (fertility prediction and chances of conception) locked up and only being able to track *symptoms* I have grown to hate this once lovable and arguably essential tool."
467,2,"I used this app free for years and was happy with it's basic prediction functions, but recently I switched phones and all my data was lost. The login feature is totally broken and no matter which option I choose it takes me to an error page. I guess I won't miss the constant push for premium now that I've switched to a new app."
468,5,This app is great for tracking and predicting your period. I really like that you can change the focus based on your goals like getting pregnant or just simply tracking your cycle. I use the app all the time to plan trips. There are also some good articles and recommendations from professionals in the app. I would recommend this app.
469,3,this app could be awesome if there was a bit more inclusivity. I want to track my hormonal cycles while I have an IUD and there's no options without actively bleeding. there's also no entries for some of my regular symptoms and it is 99% centered around pregnancy and ovulation. theres a lot more to women's hormonal health and cycles and I would love to see an app like this that wasn't targeted at women trying to get pregnant or avoid getting pregnant.
470,3,"App is great for tracking moods, periods, and many other symptoms that helped me understand my body better. I had premium for a year or two and the advice didn't really change or was specifically tailored to me. I stopped premium and now when I click on content I'm not allowed to see anything, even though I thought some of it was basic health knowledge."
471,3,"I like Flo and have been using it for years. There's a few things that could be improved, though. #1, Paywall; having the insights behind a paywall is nonsense. Offer them as a one-time low-cost payment to have access if need be. #2, the constant pop-up to subscribe; this is beyond annoying. #3, no sign-in after a reinstall; having to go through that whole questionnaire process again is frustrating & time consuming. #4 Subscription cost; absolutely ridiculous for a period tracker app."
472,1,"worst tracking app. I'm so tired of getting asked for money. Especially when most of the ""advice"" or reasoning for things can be simply googled. Thought it would be convenient to have an app that has it all in one place, but paying for that is outrageous and comical. And usually I have no issue with apps that have a subscription, to each their own if they want to pay for a membership, don't care. But there is no touching anything on the app without the dang pop up to pay"
473,4,"update: had to re-login after getting a new phone and there needs to be an option to login before the long intro sequence. The intro should also just be fully skippable, and I could do without the ""long press"" to set my intentions. While I appreciate the personalization, forcing us to click through feels condescending. It's up to me why I use this app, that's the whole point. The process is enough to scare off new users as well. I've used flo for a long time, but these changes give me pause."
474,2,"it's fine for tracking periods, but it won't stop shoving a subscription in your face. It feels like every time you open the app, every time you click on something, read something, close something, it has to ask if you want to buy a subscription. It gets real annoying real fast. There are probably better tracker apps out there tbh."
475,2,"This app has a hard time with my irregular periods. When I log a period it doesn't always restart my cycle. Because of that, it often tells me to take pregnancy tests when I know I'm not pregnant. That chat bot conversations aren't very informative or personalized. I regret paying for the app for a year. I can see how it'd be useful for someone with more regular periods."
476,1,"I stopped paying for it when they started to give false biology. the app does nothing special other than track your pregnancy and period while looking pretty. other than that it prohibits the basic free information you can get from Google unless you pay for it to be shown on the app, there are several free apps that provide way more accurate information and articles without making a subscription. everything in the app is achievable for free."
477,4,"it's a very good tracker, and most of my periods have been right on track, I appreciate they allow a free trial, which is great, and I understand this can't be free but most things are restricted the only thing you can really do is track and chat with strangers but sometimes its not that helpful, Not everyone has money for it, and I think a simple solution is to allow at least 3 free articles, but this is just a recommendation."
478,2,"I believe the app would be really great If not for the constant asking to pay for the subscription. A reminder from time to time is fine, but it's a little overwhelming when it's done too much. A change in that direction would definitely make people more eager to actually consider the payment, while now it just gets annoying instead of encouraging."
479,1,"This app will let you open the app without creating an account. If you have to replace your phone or app is removed, you will never get your medical data back. The yrs of logging your data is just gone. If you remember info and want to back log, you can't. I'm very disappointed with how they can not pull up my account, even after sending proof of payment from my email. I'm pregnant right now and had important info in notes. Save your time and go somewhere else."
480,2,"It's advertised as one of the best ""free"" period tracking apps (which is why I downloaded), but every touchpoint is interrupted by a pay wall. It will waste your time with seemingly ""complimentary"" features only to hit you with the credit card request 20 questions in. Super annoying. would love a suggestion for an alternative. I think if you're trying to get pregnant it makes sense to pay, but it's annoying they advertise so much as a ""free"" platform when that tier is REALLY annoying to use"
481,4,"The app is great and really helped me understand my body and menstrual cycle better. One suggestion: please consider recording menstrual days based on the exact time it starts (e.g. 9 PM) instead of counting it as a full day. Also, it would be better if we get to track the amount of exercise, vaginal discharge, and sleep hours. These details can support a more personalized and effective women‚Äôs health routine. Keep up the great work!"
482,2,"I've had this app for a few years now, i love that it will tell me when my monthly is coming but I hate how it is constantly telling to sign up for a plan. Why give me the option to learn more about MY body but then turn around and put a price tage on it. 7.99 a month is crazy but 39.99 a year is too. Especially for a teenage girl who's just now learning everything. Like I want to learn more about me and my body without losing money."
483,5,love this app and the support team. I had an old email address I deleted that I had used to sign up for flo with and when I got a new phone I couldn't access my account!! fortunately however I'd used a different account to purchase premium with and support managed to merge the accounts so I could access my 2 years of data with!! they were so helpful and just lovely!!
484,2,"I've been using this app for about a decade now. It was the first app I downloaded to help me track my irregular periods. This app helped me communicate with my doctor and my partner better and helped me get insight into my body. At first, you could get information you could google for free now. You have to pay for the short articles or to be diagnosed. Every time I open the app, there is one less free feature."
485,2,Have been using this app for about two years or so. Used to be a really good app but now you cannot use most of the features without it pestering for you to buy their premium subscription. It seems that they have taken most of the insights and features away from the free download and want you to pay the subscription for them now.
486,2,"it's very good at tracking your period but the reason I downloaded the app, is locked behind a pay wall üòû. I wanted the advice features and how to deal with certain things as a teenager but you can't click on anything without it being included in the premium membership. I wish flo could make it more accessible for teens that most likely don't have money but still wants advice üòÖ"
487,1,"This app asks for preferences, whether you're in a relationship, sexually active, etc. and then promptly ignores all your preferences and shows you articles and notifications about the stuff you didn't ask for anyway. This, of course, is only after premium has been thrown in your face so many times you forget that this app even has a single free feature. Which it really doesn't, their chat bot can't finish a complete thought without pulling out the beggar routine. wouldn't recommend"
488,5,I originally wanted to use this so I could compare calendars with another app and I've only had it for like 2 days so far but I actually really love all the features. my Fianc√© is able to look at a lot more information than the other one I had and it asks a lot of questions. I'm about to find out if all the questions help with accurate information because this says my monthly is due tomorrow and my other one says a little under a week. I'll report back soon
489,5,"This app is truly amazing, had it since high school. I will give this app 5 stars if you guys added in the other forms of birth control that other women like myself have that might cause you not to have your period for a whole year or 2. I think that would be a game changer for you guys. Keep doing your thing ü§óüíï Edit: Nevermind, I just found those options in the app, 5 stars!!!"
490,2,"The app is pretty decent. I downloaded it just to track my period, so all the sex life and pregnancy tracking questions weren't the best thing to open the app to, and as a queer asexual person it was not very fun to be bombarded with all that. Especially since I'm fairly sure that all of those sex education were about straight sex. Which leads to my second critique of the app, without paying all the insights and articles are off limit. This app is pretty much just a period tracker with sex ads."
491,2,"This is a great app, with the major exception that this app really pushes the monthly or yearly subscription at every possible opportunity. If you don't want or can't afford the subscription, it's a real pain. I just want to track my cycle. It would be amazing if I could turn off the articles (most of which need a subscription to read). However, for tracking your period, this app is the best on the market (I've tried a fair number)."
492,4,"I've used this app for many years and love the prediction and analysis data and anonymous features. The bad is that while I understand the purpose of premium, I feel like it gets push way too frequently and caused me to use the app less (only for tracking). When they introduced the partner feature, it was so limited that my partner paid for the premium which then gave it to me. The partner feature is great but needs some work which I'll submit through their email."
493,1,"Used to be the best tracking app ever and I've been using it for the past 8-9 years. Unfortunately, it has been made clear that now they just care about money because half the things you used to be able to read/learn/do on the app now are hidden behind a paywall when they didn't use to be. Literally feel like I can't click anything without being told I need to have a subscription now. Finishing my pregnancy out with it just for tracking the weeks then switching to a different period tracker."
494,2,"if you're a free user this app is really annoying. they dont clearly state what is a premium feature, so you end up clicking on many things only to get a prompt to subscribe. I understand its a business and you need money. but all other apps show what's premium by using a star or crown icon on those features so you can make the decision for yourself if you want to click. this has given me a really negative view on the app even though the premium stuff looks really interesting bc I feel tricked"
495,4,"it's simple and I like the features they have, but almost all of them are behind a paywall except the symptoms tracker. don't expect much else from this app unless you plan on paying for it. And to be honest forcing people to pay for health education leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I'm not saying make the whole app free, but at least leave important/basic information available to everyone."
496,1,"EDIT:Still 1 ‚≠êÔ∏è.After being told there is a free version with a tracker & notifications, it took 5 tries to close out the subscription popup.I wasn't told all you can track is your period. I get notifications for other categories I expressed interest in, but can't access any w/o paying.Subscription popups are aggressive & constant.Free version should have access to most of the other features, even if limited to use, instead of forced to do a free trial.Bad way to gain customers.I hope it's fixed"
497,5,"One of the best period tracking apps. I have been using it for over a year or two and the predictions are so accurate, it's so helpful to know exactly what's going on with your body! The flo assistant insights are really helpful as well, the secret chat is a great feature too! Girl to girl conversations without the fear of judgement are so refreshing."
498,1,"I wanted to download a copy of my data. This is not an option in the app and you are required to contact the app support email. You only receive the same ""copy and paste"" AI generated responses via email from a 3rd party service when you attempt to contact their app support. Despite requesting a copy multiple times, Flo will not provide me with a full copy of my own period/fertility data!"
499,4,"overall very accurate. whether it be predicting how I'm going to feel or other things like that, it's very helpful. one thing I don't like is how you have to pay for half of the features. don't get me wrong, if a had the money I 100% would buy premium because it is definitely worth it, but I don't have the money so unfortunately I cant. Great app though, would recommend as a period tracked!"
500,3,"Have used this app for years. Over all I like it, easy to use/ view all the data you put in. Originally you had access to all of the extra information, slowly alot of it was blocked unless you paid. Now apart from your calander/ entering symptoms you can't view anything unless you pay and you get constant pop ups trying to get you to subscribe making 90% of the apps features redundant. Think i'll start hunting around for a new app now."
501,5,"For the most part great!! Love the app for so many reasons. The ""couples"" portion DEFINITELY needs work üò¨ Quiz answers are vague and limiting. ""none of the above"" or ""all of the above"" answers would be great. Even BETTER would be the option to type your own response, or ""choose all that apply"" options. Daily check ins for HER would also be beneficial. Daily check in answer options also need work and are very limiting. Developers!!! Help us!!!"
502,3,"The app is good, but costs too much. I bought it on sale for $20/yr; this is what I'd say it's worth, not the $60/yr they're asking for. I used it for my first pregnancy and it was informative enough. Helpful app once you get past the paywall. I'd buy it again for $20, but until then, it's useless because of the paywalls."
503,2,"I am so upset with the dark mode. I don't know who programmed it, or if anyone tested it before, but I can't see anything. Literally. The second you move to dark mode all the letters still stay white on a mostly white background. I now can't switch back to day mode or change theme, because I can't see where to click the button. It's a guessing game at this point It makes the app completely unusable. I am literally a few dead nerve endings away from deliting the app altogether"
504,5,"I have only been using Flo for a little while, but I have absolutely loved the experience. I think this app is really important and useful for girls, it helps them to understand their period and why their body may feel certain ways. it also gives you tips and tricks on beauty, and gets personal too. I think this app is amazing, especially because this is a good source to learn more about you and your periods."
505,5,Girl!! Tracking period Logging symptoms Get suggestions Keeping health logs Water tracking Partner linking You name it.... ‚≠êÔ∏è I have had this app for how long I don't remember. It has helped me keep my EVERYTHING on track since then. Definitely recommend it. But if it had more themes in black version I'd love that. ‚ú®Ô∏è. It feels like therapy when Logging in my periods üòÇ
506,3,"Pros: Best app for tracking period. It has many good features. and adding your (bf) partner is one such. cons: (needed improvement) - would be great if we can choose more symptoms like leg swelling, leg pain, chestache etc etc... - and need more discharge colors and textures... - It would be the best app ever if we include an option where our added partner can see about our symptoms, moods, and how heavy the flow is... (so atleast the üíö flag men will treat their gf better)"
507,4,"I love everything about this app. It's really accurate and it provides helpful tips and information. I wish the sync with google fit would work (sleep, period, weight) but for some reason at least for me it doesn't. It would also be very helpful if water intake and other stuff like that could be synced with apps like samsung health or health sync! Edit: A dark mode option would also be very helpful!"
508,2,"Money robbing!!! Hardly anything is free. Basically track your period, ovulation or pregnancy for free and everything else you need is behind a paywall Good app, great for tracking everything but I will say this app is terrible for the free option. You need more articles ect for free as not many people can afford the premium and some need the info but other than that, great app, very good with predictions!! I get you need to make some things money but not the whole app.. it's a joke"
509,5,"I have used flo for around 8 years or more I used it to get pregnant with my daughter(7) when my oldest son(10) was 2 even though I was in denial that I was even pregnant with her b/c with my son It took 10 years to get pregnant so this app does accurately predict the best day to concieve. It also has pregnancy mode and shows the growth of the baby, And now you can add your partner so they can see your fertility window, I 100% recommend , even if to just keep track of your cycle days."
510,4,"I absolutely love this app as it is quite accurate. 1 thing I can think of that they could do to improve the app is for it to allow u to add things to the symptoms, discharge, digestion and stool, mood, other and activity lists that it already gives u like my other app does which is actually awesome and helps make it easier to read and deal with as I instead have to add it to my notes üìù and Idk how accurately it adds those symptoms to my results."
511,3,It's an informative app but not as interactive for couples. I use it with my gf and all I get on my end is the ability to see her cycle days and ovulation windows. It would be nicer to have the ability to log her mood from my perspective if she wanted so she can get another person's input. That and other features to be logged by either person would be very useful in my opinion.
512,1,"I used to love this app. It used to provide information in the free version. I used to be able to customize it but it's just harsh white with pink text. Flo is just a glorified calendar. Tap literally any tab and it's behind a pay wall. Any topic at all. Pay wall. (And they really push the premium version in your face) It's actually frustrating. I used this app throughout my pregnancy but anything interesting I want to read, i have to pay for. It used to be convenient. I used to love Flo..."
513,3,"Very useful for recording symptoms from physical to emotional, but I can't in good conscience rate this app very high. When you record certain symptoms, the app will prompt a coded chat to assist, which is a good thing. The bad thing, however, is that many, many things are locked behind a premium plan, which is not clarified until you hit that point. It's really disheartening when the chats suggest an empathetic tone, then slip right into that ""try premium free!"" spiel."
514,2,"Bloated with repetitive and less than useful ""insights"" even on premium version. Chats seem to be full of bots making it tough to find relevant information. Not enough flexibility to deal with big changes to the cycle like PCOS. Basic tracking is algorithm based so works mostly ok if your body is consistent."
515,4,"overall the app is great, i just have a suggestion. while viewing weight chart, it shows the graph in intervals of a period cycle, it would be better if graph is continuous and not just divided into period cycles. a continuous graph will help us see how our weight is fluctuating not just for a period cycle but over time as well."
516,2,Flo is a great app. I transferred all my apps to my new phone and now it's not allowing me to get pass 'Choose your plan' all I'm seeing is reviews and it's frustrating that I can't get past it. I un-installed and reinstalled and I'm still having the same issue.
517,1,"It's been years and still no return of the dark themes that were removed and no new dark mode implemented, despite saying it would. Bit fed up of my retinas being singed every time I want to log a symptom or track my cycle. Edit: Not sure why dark mode is not available, it's 2024 almost every app has some form of dark mode implemented."
518,1,"Membership needed to access lots of content. Lots of features are presented to you but then locked by membership. Notification suggested its the best time to conceive yet first day of last period was 7 days ago? Which suggests the advice is very generic bordering on inaccurate. Too many features, notifications and membership pop ups that it's more hassle than it's worth to track my period."
519,1,"It's a very nice app. It worked well until I changed my device. After that, I haven't been able to access my account. I haven't been able to reach anyone from customer support. I paid for the year, so annoying. Update: Customer support finally reached out and there was no way to recover my info. The app is really nice, but it's unfortunate that something as common as changing a device will make you all the info you've been tracking."
520,5,"The app is designed perfectly for women. I've been using it for more than a year, and it helps me to track my irregular menstrual cycle. The prediction is quite accurate. So far, there's No better app than this one to help me gain the monthly insight about my own body. It's super easy to use, it definitely helpful for those who struggle with irregular menstrual cycle or those who want to get pregnant. Love this app so muchhh...."
521,2,"To who it may concern, Please come to my assistance. Earlier today I noticed I had been charged for a premium subscription and I don't remember authorising it. It doesn't show on my Google play, but my Flo account has now changed to premium. I have no order receipt, or record of the transaction on my Google account. Can you come to my assistance? This is expensive and I want to cancel the subscription, request a refund and go back to Flo basic. It's very frustrating trying to figure this out."
522,2,"Somewhat useful, I only use the free mode. The tracker is accurate for periods, Useless when you're pregnant. I get constant notifications which I can't turn off, most things that are recommended are locked behind a paywall. I can't change how far along I am so everything pushed at me is irrelevant and inaccessible. I'm so close to uninstalling purely because of the notification harassment."
523,4,"Have used the app for years and always paid for the premium account. I noticed the app changed my profile to track cycle and not get pregnant. When trying to change, the subscription goes up to ¬£44.99 instead of ¬£14.99 which it currently is. Also, I recently got the Oura ring which says it can connect to Flo. However it seems impossible. The instructions to connect don't match with the app and there is nowhere in Flo that mentions supporting apps."
524,1,"Free partner version is extremely simple, no added value rather than being able to track my partner's cycle on the calendar. The given advices are very superficial and doesn't align much. All that topped with extreme pushy approach on singing up for the paid version. Every time I open the app I have to skip to several ""stories"" about the paid verson to then open the app. Got access to anything in the app rather than the calendar and the ""advices"". Super limited n annoying! U guys can do better."
525,2,"The app itself is good. I like the functions and everything. The only problem is that whatever you click, it pops up that the function is only available with a subscription. Sometimes even if you don't click any paid function, ads still pop up. I realize the hard work etc. but it's starting to get really annoying and it's hard to use the app if everything is locked under a subscription, especially when the trial version is no longer available."
526,1,"Love the graphics, but that's about it. You literally can't use this app without subscribing to an overpriced plan. It's an obscene amount for what it does. Every pop-up and explanation is behind a subscription wall, and it doesn't even offer much more than a quick question to ChatGPT. For now I'll keep using the basic feature - tracking, but I wonder how long before even that is paid."
527,1,"Don't understand why people like it so much. SEVERAL times a day I get ridiculous notifications from this app telling me ""oh today you might feel like this!"" or ""expect to be more sad today"" among other things, and there isn't a single setting to be able to turn them off. I wanted a simple app that tracks my period and warns me a day or 2 in advance with notifications, but I can't turn off the notifications because then I will have no heads up about my period."
528,2,"I‚Äôve been a loyal user‚Äîpremium for four years and basic for more than five‚Äîand I used to love this app. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm now considering cancelling my premium subscription due to persistent bugs. I keep receiving notifications despite turning them off, and more importantly, the app no longer provides information about my cycle. With its core feature missing, it's hard to justify the subscription cost."
529,2,"Seems to be a great tracking app, but really not very LGBTIQA+ friendly. Usually I'm not one to mention this as I understand queer relationships are the minority, but this app could do so many small things to make it more inclusive. For example, just some slight terminology changes and the addition of a few more options in the daily tracking section would make a huge difference. Disappointing to have paid for an app which isn't built to be inclusive of my sexuality."
530,3,"Flo is a decent app and it is mostly accurate. Although accuracy is great, it is unbelievable that premium is the only way to learn additional important facts about my body. These simple features should be free, not $55.99 Canadian yearly. Even trying to understand possible period symptoms are under a premium plan. Honestly, if you are a person who wants to further educate yourself about womanly cycles, this app isn't the best option unless you would like to pay $55.99 a year or $10.99 a month."
531,1,"it's ok for tracking the cycle but first, it has a ton of unnecessary features, and second, any time I log out of the app, go log back it, I need to go THROW THE WHOLE VERY LONG ONBOARDING THAT YOU CAN'T SKIP. Wrote to support about it a couple years ago... they said it's skippable... some questions, yes, but why don't you just give registered users an option to log in directly??? and, to top this off, once I managed to log back in, my data wasn't even saved! Imma look for a new period tracker"
532,2,"I used Flo years ago, and recently came on to use it again to find that most of the app uses you are required to pay premium. The app prompts me to click on things, have daily discussions with assistance, and gives insights, all of which require premium. So I've flashed a bunch of things I can't use, totally put me off. I'd rather find an app that I can use the things shown to me without having to pay üôÉ"
533,1,"Keeps getting worse and worse with every update. Now it's really hard to see which cycle day it is and it just says ""period may start today"" for like 2 weeks. It also stopped predicting for next months!! I will check other similar apps and change. Shame after years of using Flo. Also super annoying how much it's pushing for paid subscription now. Nobody will pay for an app that keeps getting WORSE."
534,1,if I could rate it zero stars I would. I've never hated an app so much. firstly the free trial charges you before the trial period is up. secondly it constantly tells me my period is late and to do a pregnancy test. 1. it's not even close to being late and 2 I'm infertile. it's triggering as to see that notification constantly and not even be able to turn it off. As below I have emailed you awaiting a response.
535,1,"UI/UX has become so terrible for me, maybe for younger audience it's better this way but I'm always at a loss within the app. Exporting the data is overcomplicated as well so I ended up manually copying everything from several years to migrate. Would never use a service which doesn't have a clear export feature again, I don't feel like I own any data I have put in the app."
536,1,"It's so insane that they make everything so women positive, but if you want ANY useful features or ANY educational information you need premium. It's really so crazy. All you can do without premium is log the date, and for me the tracking isn't even accurate. The tracking is also manual not adapted to you personally. If you're gonna act so supportive, be so supportive."
537,1,"Annoying Because this app wipes your notes. now they added a feature that a couple days before your period it doesn't show likely ovulation dates after until you actually log your period. Which is very annoying because you cannot make tentative plans. It now adds two ""possible"" period dates to your estimated period and doesn't give you an option to leave it off. I left this app once before due to being inundated with ads and unsolicited pop ups about things I'm not interested in. Not coming back"
538,2,"You regularly give me some discount or 100 days streak ""gift"" but I am unable to open and see what is it. It keeps sending me on this page and nothing happens - it just opens Play store at you app and that's about it. That's annoying. And without payong there is literally no change even to put different email adress or anything it just bugs the whole phone if you try. I do have S24 ultra - it's quite fast for anything but this app when I try to get any of your gifts."
539,3,"I kinda like the app because it looks resourceful, been having it for 3 years now but I Uninstalled at a point because I couldn't find a use for it aside log period and read chats . like , what's the point of seeing resources and yet not being granted any access to them ? like, I really want to know if there's something you can READ or DO on Flo without necessarily paying for premium. Not everyone can pay for premium use of the app ,so at least quite a few stuff should be left accessible."
540,5,"One of the Best Period Tracking Apps! I've been using Flo for a while now, and it has truly made a difference in how I track and understand my cycle. The app is beautifully designed, easy to use, and extremely accurate with predictions. I love how it not only tracks periods and ovulation but also provides insightful articles, health tips, and reminders. It‚Äôs like having a mini health assistant in my pocket."
541,1,"Tried to pay for subscription as almost everything is behind a paywall but the verification page is faulty. Input fields for verification codes don't work, nothing comes up when trying to enter numerical data. App developers need to look into this as customers can't pay for subscriptions, surprised this was not caught through QA testing."
542,1,"It was a great app until I tried to cancel after having a baby and a hysterectomy. I've spent a year trying to figure it out and it turns out I had two subscriptions, they were charging me for both and I didn't want either. It feels like you have to click a 100 times to cancel and jump through flaming hoops of fire. And you are screwed of you forget your log in or switch from IPhone to android. An absolutely terrible experience and and expensive learning curve."
543,4,love all the info you get from it definitely worth it. the only thing I wish it had was a widget that tracks the days of your cycle like a count down to it. the only widget they have is to track the growth of your baby which is awesome but not all of us are pregnant. so now I have two period apps on my phone one with a widget that show the day of my cycle and when I'm ovulating and one with an insane amount of info one everything.
544,4,"very useful for your basic needs. only thing stopping me from 5 stars is that pretty much every single feature you need to have premium for. I don't mind that for some cos obviously they gotta make money somehow but I do wish a couple more features, particularly insights about my health could perhaps be part of the free package. still a very useful app though for tracking so definitely recommend for that"
545,1,"I am not ""active"" and it keeps giving me notifications trying to make me scared, for example, ""you're 2 days late! you're 5 days late! you're 7 days late!"" this is literally just a data farming app (it collects data so it knows when you're craving chocolate, then it shows you advertisements for chocolate) zero stars"
546,2,"used to use it just to track my cycle but honestly this is not a good app at all. way too many ads and advertisements of their own app ,in app - WHILE being subscribed to premium. you can't access your information offline either. the ""useful"" insight you get is 8th grade biology at best. probably better apps out there , definitely don't reccomend this one though. you're better off tracking on paper and a calendar. and the weird kinky sex forums are... questionable"
547,5,"The app is so good, BUT, since i can't upgrade to the premium version it becomes so annoying when they ask me to, like almost everything requires premium, there are apps that can do the free options in the app without nagging about the upgrade! Please give more freedom to the users of the free version. Thank you. Update: great app, thank you so much. Recommandation: I wish you can add changes in body temperature to the symptoms feature, because many women feel reallt cold or hot during period"
548,5,"Love this app! Very easy to use and the interface is easy to understand. I downloaded it for assistance in tracking my period and ovulation for family planning purposes. And now, with its help, I'm happily 17 weeks expecting as a first time mom ü•∞ So I've switched to its pregnancy tracker feature, which has also been helpful with tidbits of interesting information!"
549,5,"I was recommended Flo by a friend as I was having irregular periods after coming off contraception. After a few periods were logged the predictions have been pretty spot on, so I feel much more at ease knowing when my period will be. I really like this app and find it most useful!"
550,1,"re-download this app because i used to use it religiously, i switched over to samsung health when i got my new phone, but its just not the same, i re-downloaded & it charged me for a subscription the day i got it, when i never signed up for one, i just wanted the basic free version just too keep track of my body and my cycle.. $40 later !!!! i love the app itself. it's very accurate, but im very aggravated that this happened üò§"
551,5,"I recently started using the Flo app to track my periods and I‚Äôm really enjoying it so far! The app looks bright, friendly, and very easy to use. It lets me log my period dates, flow, moods, symptoms, and even daily feelings, which helps me understand my body better. Flo gives clear reminders for upcoming periods, fertile windows, and ovulation days, which is super helpful. There are lots of helpful health articles and tips related to women‚Äôs health and wellness."
552,2,"I am generally happy with this application and have been using it for years. the only reason I am giving it a low rating is in hopes that a developer can address an issue I gave recently been experiencing. The functionality that I ise daily is the contraceptive reminders, but as of late the reminders do not come everyday. they skip days at random which is extremely problematic"
553,3,"it's a great app for tracking my period, but also a total cash grab. I can't look at anything to learn or for advice without needing the premium feature. the app gives a bunch of free trials, but I feel like there should be more things you could be able to do without having to pay."
554,3,"Great app, but SO FREAKING BUSY. As soon as you open the app, the freaking Flo AI companion pops up every single time (I am not interested in this feature at all and cant find a way to turn it off), a million things try to update at once, and the entire interface is just TOO MUCH. Disorganized and chaotic. I really find this app incredibly frustrating to use and extremely overstimulating even when Im NOT having a menstrual-induced migraine. When I'm actually on my period, this app is unbearable."
555,3,"overall app does what I want it to do, let's me see my cycle so I can predict around when my period happens again. although I know subscriptions help keep the up running it is a bit weird to put stuff life ""finding out why your cycle is irregular"" behind it??? or information that can be very useful about periods behind that paywall."
556,5,"I really love this app and all the symptoms you can log to help you get to know your own cycle and what to expect. I have a request to add something to the symptoms if that's possible. It would be great for position of cervix (high/low) and firmness (soft/hard) to be added, as a lot of women track this whilst trying to conceive."
557,3,i gave this app a 5 star before because of the secret chats but recently they're not updating. i can see there are posts when i click on a tag but it's not showing up on my feed. my feed is filled with old posts like from 4 to 6 days ago. AND i don't think my own posts are being shown on others feed because i don't get any responses recently when i used to get so many instantly before. I've tried logging in and out and reinstalling but no use
558,1,I'm having issues logging back in since I got a new phone. When you put in my email which is registered the account I pay for it opened a new account. The new account does not include any of my saved information nor the subscription I pay for it. Can you please provide me with someone to contact in regard to how to fix this. In the meantime I'll be canceling my subscription. Signing in has been a pain and full of pop up after pop up after pop-up even once I do get to the login screen.
559,2,"It's a very misleading app. If you don't have premium (which I had, not worth it), it'll walk you through a ""conversation"" with an AI but when you get to the end of the conversation, it tells you that you need to pay to see the answers. If you just want to track your period, it's perfectly fine for that. But if you want to read articles or have questions about your period, just use google ladies. It's free and much quicker (and you don't have to have a painful conversation with an AI)."
560,5,I love this app & how it helps me keep track of my shark week every month but it is insane on how you have to pay for this app & it being so much is ridiculous for a tracker of my shark week when I can do so with a regular calendar & or my note & reminder on my cellphone... 20 something a month or more is just not a price range everyone can afford for this app & I think it should be free to a extent but still have the options of everything unless you wanted to upgrade .
561,1,"Awful app, barely works and when it does, they either sell your data or loose it (or both). Constant pop-ups and notifications begging to pay for the monthly subscription like it's their full time job. If you enjoy getting harrased to pay so they can mishandle your personal information, you'll love it. The ceo has the same vibes as the app, desperate and shady."
562,1,"For the longest time this app has really helped me and has been accurate in tracking my flow and ovulation days but of late I feel like it has a glitch. How is it possible for it to show me that I'm fertile a day after I receive my periods!!! It doesn't update my cycle and I can't see beyond two months,right now we're in August I can't see my cycle predictions beyond October. I thought my fertile period comes two weeks after my period but in the app it shows my fertile days are two days after p"
563,4,"[Edited] Thank you so much for the feedback and for giving premium subscription‚ù§Ô∏è However after I compare Flo with a few other cycle apps, Flo lacks the cycle phase info (such as luteal phase, etc.) Please add this feature so we could specifically know which cycle phase we're in. Also please add sickness symptoms tracker such as common cold or fever, etc. I've been using Flo for 7 years and I don't want to switch. Thank you! :)"
564,3,"frustrated by how much appears to be included in the ""free"" app, yet when clicked it just tries to get you to sign up to premium. At least put the locked symbol on the front so I know not to even bother trying to look at it!"
565,5,wonderful app. sometimes not everything syncs up completely that's a bit unfortunate when looking at the summary of the month. but otherwise still a very useful app and I would recommend it to everyone. even your partner can participate with his side of the app to check in on you and the cycle.
566,2,"took 20mins to gather tons of information about myself, get all the way to end and then they make you choose a subscription to be able to fully use the app! They should tell you that from the very beginning instead of going through all the personal info for setup then not being able to use unless you pay... why does everything have to cost something...atleast state it from the beginning don't withhold until the very end!!"
567,1,"Not about helping women but profiting off women. They don't let you extract your own data for medical tracking. I have PMDD, and having an app that tracked mental+physical symptoms seemed great. I paid full, & logged symptoms for 2 years to get data for diagnosis. Nope. They keep your data and it cannot be extracted. Now, they've got rid of other useful things to help manage hormonal challenges, like weight and sleep logs. 1/8/25: can't just login if on new device! make you walk through set upüò°"
568,2,"nothing special. The assumption and articles are not that useful. Everyday pregnancy symptoms are random: today's and tomorrow's will not be the same in the app, but they are the same in life. All the app is doing is calculating weeks of pregnancy. It could be free for only one useful feature."
569,4,great app love the tracking and daily insight! I only gave it a 4 star because i think the app is a bit pricey and now you cant even see the daily insights. I did pay for a year but not anymore to pricey i can just track it in my calendar. now that I'm pregnant i will just look for another app.
570,4,I appreciate that I can use the basic functions without a subscription while I am on a fixed income. The app is easy to use and intuitive to navigate and the design and layout are very clean. The only issue I've noticed is that occasionally it will not let me apply changes in the symptom tracker unless I close the app and restart it. Otherwise it functions without issue.
571,1,"Tedious, incredibly long and scrutinicious onboarding. It must be a joke. Also, you can't skip this superlong onboarding. I couldn't log in my account, because the app won't send the password recovery link to my email. 0/10. Excel is better, ladies"
572,3,"I'm a very new user (one week), so I've got a lot to observe, but I wish you could further personalize the articles and be able to suppress what you don't want to see. I'm not yet perimenopausal or trying to get pregnant, yet that takes up a lot of space on my landing page. Other than that, so far, so good."
573,1,"Crazy how Flo has changed over the years. There used to be some educational content for free users but now it's all fear-mongering with the info hidden behind a paywall which is a cruel concept tbh. I also feel like the period predictions aren't as good as they used to be, so it's kind of become useless to me. Switching to a different app with safer privacy, too. All Flo users should keep an eye on the class action."
574,3,"This app looks great, but for me it was not simple to use, rather annoying. To much repeatable questions about how do I feel and what desease did I have, etc. Tons of other options. I just wanted to use it for tracking my periods, that's all :)"
575,4,"I have the paid version, I really like it BUT I would like to be able to filter the calendar to see what days I had certain symptoms. I can only see them manually if I click on a specific day. It has predictions but what I need is my symptoms history (all the days in the past year or so I logged in those symptoms) for medical reasons. I hope they add this feature since this medical issue is one of the reasons I started using the app in the first place. Otherwise it's great, I really love it."
576,5,(Perfect app....for me.... It is easy to handle..) that was my review 6 years back.. I should write more I think..as a user from 2018 flo never disappointed me even once...now I understand my menstrual cycle a lot more... the cycle prediction is wow..I mean 100% precise in my case...I love this app and I suggested this to many girls I know...they are also happy with it ...Lots of love keep going ‚ù§Ô∏è
577,4,"its pretty good even just using the free version. visually appealing, interesting information, and fairly customizable. one thing i dont like - when you enter your weight it defaults to what your weight ""should"" be (bmi or something similar) for your height/gender, not your last recorded weight. makes me self conscious + avoid the feature altogether"
578,3,"it's a good app for tracking your period, but literally EVERYTHING else is hidden behind a pay wall like bye. With all the access we have to other free information, there's no point in paying that much for a period tracker app."
579,2,"overall, a good app. it helps me track when im on and when im off quite nicely. my problem is the fact that you have to be on premium to get good forms of information. i cant afford premium because im 13, but my parents dont tell me these things so if Flo could it would be nice. i dont have a credit card to do the free trial either, so its disappointing."
580,5,This app is very useful and very helpful to me. I've been using this for how many years until now. I recommend this to any other girls out there. You also need this app. You can track your period anytime and you would know what's happening in your body? if there's something wrong? and if you are advance or delayed? Also if you are forgetful you badly need this.
581,4,"I love flo so much. It's been the only tracker to adapt to an irregular period cycle right away, which has been such a big help to me. I love all the chats with others going through similar things and I love that I'm able to share it all with my boyfriend on his phone. it makes our lives easier. however, I really wish it had a way to track how different birth controls are affecting you and track insertion dates for non pill options, and maybe a reminder when to book that Dr visit."
582,1,"Downloaded the app, only to be asked 3 million questions (some that had nothing to do with tracking ovulation), and then had to press some button on the screen for several seconds to ""commit"" to the app (super corny and annoying), only to then be told I had to pay yearly or monthly. The process is very tedious and frustrating. It doesn't matter what you click on on the app, if you haven't paid, you can't read anything. Frustrating and annoying experience. Uninstalling."
583,4,"Incredibly useful for tracking periods, as it adjusts to changes. I wish we could turn off, or skip parts of, the bot chat stuff. Its programming/information is too general and ultimately restrictive. I also would like more symptom options, even just an add your own that you can select again as needed. Thanks for the app!"
584,2,"I've had this app for about 5 years and really just used it to track my periods, which it is decent for. But over time, more and more features have been locked behind a paywall and I got very annoyed at the pop-ups telling me to buy a plan. The final straw was a bug that kept putting my symptoms on one day and my flow on the next, despite logging both on the same day. I just don't see the point in continuing to use an annoying and buggy app. I plan on tracking my periods on paper now."
585,1,"The only reason I still use this app is because it's been my tracking app for the last 8 years now. They keep taking away free features and making them only available with the paid subscription. I'm now pregnant again for the third time and now it won't even tell me anything other than how far along I am. Any insight it offers is no longer free! I have a feeling soon it won't even be free to use it at all. I would switch if it were easy to export my data into another app, but it's not."
586,2,"I loved this app, it was accurate and it allowed me to track my periods as well as my ovulation dates AND allowed me to monitor any abnormalities and as someone who has always had very irregular periods it was great. However now they want me to pay for all the things that made it great and I can no longer monitor for any issues like I used to without paying?! As women we are already nickel and dimed for items like pads and I might as well just go back to using a calendar if all I get is tracking"
587,2,"Some of the couples quizzes and information are kinda nice but as a period tracker couple sharing app it's terrible. She puts all her information in in detail and I get practically none of that information on my side even though that was our intention. There is no setting to change it either, it's locked away. I would understand if it was a privacy thing for some couples but it should be an option in her settings not locked away for everyone."
588,1,"Great for period tracking. Before pregnancy 5 star. Postpartum, more like a 1 star app. Now it seems the app is struggling. The calendar knows I was pregnant but does not take into account postpartum or breastfeeding. Just wish there was an option to put in breastfeeding and postpartum, so it's not constantly trying to tell me something is wrong with my cycle."
589,2,"It's nice to be able to track my period but instead of grabbing a pen and paper to do that I downloaded this because with how much is in the app I thought there would be more for free then just a period calendar. I expected understand and insights, and yet everything little thing I clicked on I had to pay for. The thing is, is that I would have paid for it if there was a bit more for free. This app wasn't created to help it was created for self purposes. nothing on here to help is for free."
590,3,"I've been using Flo for 5+ years, and it has been mostly great. Flo can predict my period often down to the day, and is helpful for tracking ovulation. Unfortunately in more recent years, they have progressively gotten rid of a lot of the free features that used to be included (such as evaluation chats, and articles), that now you have to pay for premium to use. It feels like everything that would be helpful to use to learn more about your cycle, they want you to have premium to access."
591,2,I wanna give it more stars become it is the best when it comes to tracking and getting tips and tricks for anything but I'm saying two stars because you only have access to like two things unless you pay. it's ridiculously expensive. why the heck do we have to pay for a pregnancy tracker or a health tracker in general. if we need the help and guidance it should be free our health shouldn't come with a cost. it's literally useless app without premium. please do something I loved this app
592,3,"I used to really like the app because for the free verison, yoi still got some knowledge about things you log or when you're pregnant, really helpful info about the baby as it grows. I got a new phone and couldn't access my account wasn't a big deal, bc I just made a new one, but now I cant acces I was able b4 other than logging my symptoms or settings. I can't look pretty much anything on the app bc it just puts me on page to buy the premium option. Im even locked out from the calendar."
593,3,"overall balanced app. 1 big nit pick is how you enter your weight. maybe some find having to spin and spin the weight wheele pleasing, I do not. if you could just tap and enter it like most other apps I would be more inclined to increase the rating. the other thing I noticed is that the overall design is simple but almost lacks in esthetic. back ground options, better/ more intricate designs. something of that nature would be awesome. these 2 things would add a star each in my opinion."
594,2,"it used to be a great app for tracking my period. once I paid for premium all it does is send me ads to renew which is so annoying. Whenever the app has a glitch and I have to reinstall it, it takes 15 mins to skip all of the questions,log back into my account. All of the information it had about pregnancy was inaccurate. The estimated sizes didn't match anything that I sourced from other sites, plus considering I was paying a premium for the feature the BUMP was free, accurate with 3D images."
595,4,"Overall great experience with this app. There are a few selections I'd love to see added. I had to stop birth control (after 16 years) for health reasons, and I wanted to keep track of my cycle as my body regulated, and so I could reduce my chances of getting pregnant, but that's not an option when asked why I got the app. I also use this as a mood/general well-being tracker, and noting how much quality sleep I got the night before would be super helpful to spot patterns there."
596,1,"This app is seriously one of those that are only out there for whatever they can get from whatever sucker is naive enough to sign up for my free trial. Most apps/companies have no problem refunding you- especially if it's within 5 minutes of being charged and reaching out to their customer service. They charged me at midnight, hoping I would not see, but I did. I find their services useless, that's why I deleted it a day after I downloaded it, I just forgot to cancel my subscription. üö´‚ùåüö´"
597,1,"I answered a million questions only to be told I had to pay a subscription for the data analysis. I declined and then got a message saying ""befire you start, we have a gift for you"". I clicked on it to find out that it was just a discounted yearly subscription. Even though I had not gotten a subscription, there was a box on my home page saying ""today's chance of pregnancy"" with a tick underneath but when I clicked, I was taken to the page of different subscriptions."
598,2,I had this app years ago and loved it so decided to download it again a couple of months ago. I'm disappointed in the amount of times I'm being asked to pay for a subscription. I used this app before with very minimal ads and there was no pressure to pay for premium. And now I can't escape the pop-ups multiple times just by opening the app I find myself just ignoring it and not actually using it because you're constantly being pushed to buy l.
599,1,dislike it. you have to subscribe and pay to view the simplest things on the app. not worth it unless you pay. the max you can do there is just tract your cycle. you can't use anything else mor read anything on there unless you pay. get another app that can help you and an app where you can do much more. this is not worth it. if you don't want to pay every month. and it's pretty expensive too when other apps offer so much more without paying.
600,1,"Edit 2025: my last review was complaining about the constant pop-ups and chats, that would only be useful if I paid for premium. I don't need them, anyway. Recently I got a new phone, and all of my tracking data for the last 2 years disappeared. So, I'm starting from scratch. I only need this to track my phases, which it can barely do, apparently. Will probably just transition to my Fitbit app exclusively, since it still has all my data from 2018 no problem."
601,1,"I've used the app for 9 years or so. App is only good for basic tracking unless you want to pay extra, I can do that on a paper calendar. The amount of stuff behind a pay wall is ridiculous and out of hand. I'm officially going to start looking for a different app. plus the data leaks? no thanks."
602,1,"I enjoyed using this app and it was always somewhat accurate but it kicked me out of my account for no reason. i switched phones and tried signing back in but it wont accept my email or password (which i know is correct) and when I tried to send reset instructions to my email, it won't send. this is all right after I finally caved and paid for the subscription. Now I can't even access the app."
603,1,"I have been apart of Flo since it's release and it's so sad to see the money grab app it's turned into today. Some of us use this app just to stay organized about the changes in our cycles, now you can't even open the app or navigate through it without a pop up begging for money. If I didn't only use it 5 days out of the month or didn't have 10 years worth of data stored I'd probably switch apps. Plus there's a whole class action lawsuit going on so that's fun!"
604,4,Great app! Very helpful! Just wish it weren't so pushy with premium. Everytime I go into the app it sends me a pop-up asking me to talk about how I feel because of that time. I try to ignore it but I really wish I could turn off those pop-ups. Other than that it's a solid period tracker. Even for my irregular cycles.
605,3,"I've used this app for 6+ years and I really loved it. unfortunately for the past year or two the app has been fairly glitchy for me. It no longer saves my logged periods to the point it's telling me I'm over a year late. it fails to predict cycle dates too. finally having to let this app go, which is sad as I've used it with all of my pregnancies."
606,2,"it was wonderful for years until now. the most essential features are officially only accessible via payment. tracking is useless to me now with all the information essentially being held hostage with a price point. five years ago, it was awesome. all the information was generally free. now with the most basic feature (fertility prediction and chances of conception) locked up and only being able to track *symptoms* I have grown to hate this once lovable and arguably essential tool."
607,2,"I used this app free for years and was happy with it's basic prediction functions, but recently I switched phones and all my data was lost. The login feature is totally broken and no matter which option I choose it takes me to an error page. I guess I won't miss the constant push for premium now that I've switched to a new app."
608,5,This app is great for tracking and predicting your period. I really like that you can change the focus based on your goals like getting pregnant or just simply tracking your cycle. I use the app all the time to plan trips. There are also some good articles and recommendations from professionals in the app. I would recommend this app.
609,3,this app could be awesome if there was a bit more inclusivity. I want to track my hormonal cycles while I have an IUD and there's no options without actively bleeding. there's also no entries for some of my regular symptoms and it is 99% centered around pregnancy and ovulation. theres a lot more to women's hormonal health and cycles and I would love to see an app like this that wasn't targeted at women trying to get pregnant or avoid getting pregnant.
610,3,"App is great for tracking moods, periods, and many other symptoms that helped me understand my body better. I had premium for a year or two and the advice didn't really change or was specifically tailored to me. I stopped premium and now when I click on content I'm not allowed to see anything, even though I thought some of it was basic health knowledge."
611,3,"I like Flo and have been using it for years. There's a few things that could be improved, though. #1, Paywall; having the insights behind a paywall is nonsense. Offer them as a one-time low-cost payment to have access if need be. #2, the constant pop-up to subscribe; this is beyond annoying. #3, no sign-in after a reinstall; having to go through that whole questionnaire process again is frustrating & time consuming. #4 Subscription cost; absolutely ridiculous for a period tracker app."
612,1,"worst tracking app. I'm so tired of getting asked for money. Especially when most of the ""advice"" or reasoning for things can be simply googled. Thought it would be convenient to have an app that has it all in one place, but paying for that is outrageous and comical. And usually I have no issue with apps that have a subscription, to each their own if they want to pay for a membership, don't care. But there is no touching anything on the app without the dang pop up to pay"
613,4,"update: had to re-login after getting a new phone and there needs to be an option to login before the long intro sequence. The intro should also just be fully skippable, and I could do without the ""long press"" to set my intentions. While I appreciate the personalization, forcing us to click through feels condescending. It's up to me why I use this app, that's the whole point. The process is enough to scare off new users as well. I've used flo for a long time, but these changes give me pause."
614,2,"it's fine for tracking periods, but it won't stop shoving a subscription in your face. It feels like every time you open the app, every time you click on something, read something, close something, it has to ask if you want to buy a subscription. It gets real annoying real fast. There are probably better tracker apps out there tbh."
615,2,"This app has a hard time with my irregular periods. When I log a period it doesn't always restart my cycle. Because of that, it often tells me to take pregnancy tests when I know I'm not pregnant. That chat bot conversations aren't very informative or personalized. I regret paying for the app for a year. I can see how it'd be useful for someone with more regular periods."
616,1,"I stopped paying for it when they started to give false biology. the app does nothing special other than track your pregnancy and period while looking pretty. other than that it prohibits the basic free information you can get from Google unless you pay for it to be shown on the app, there are several free apps that provide way more accurate information and articles without making a subscription. everything in the app is achievable for free."
617,4,"it's a very good tracker, and most of my periods have been right on track, I appreciate they allow a free trial, which is great, and I understand this can't be free but most things are restricted the only thing you can really do is track and chat with strangers but sometimes its not that helpful, Not everyone has money for it, and I think a simple solution is to allow at least 3 free articles, but this is just a recommendation."
618,2,"I believe the app would be really great If not for the constant asking to pay for the subscription. A reminder from time to time is fine, but it's a little overwhelming when it's done too much. A change in that direction would definitely make people more eager to actually consider the payment, while now it just gets annoying instead of encouraging."
619,1,"This app will let you open the app without creating an account. If you have to replace your phone or app is removed, you will never get your medical data back. The yrs of logging your data is just gone. If you remember info and want to back log, you can't. I'm very disappointed with how they can not pull up my account, even after sending proof of payment from my email. I'm pregnant right now and had important info in notes. Save your time and go somewhere else."
620,2,"It's advertised as one of the best ""free"" period tracking apps (which is why I downloaded), but every touchpoint is interrupted by a pay wall. It will waste your time with seemingly ""complimentary"" features only to hit you with the credit card request 20 questions in. Super annoying. would love a suggestion for an alternative. I think if you're trying to get pregnant it makes sense to pay, but it's annoying they advertise so much as a ""free"" platform when that tier is REALLY annoying to use"
621,4,"The app is great and really helped me understand my body and menstrual cycle better. One suggestion: please consider recording menstrual days based on the exact time it starts (e.g. 9 PM) instead of counting it as a full day. Also, it would be better if we get to track the amount of exercise, vaginal discharge, and sleep hours. These details can support a more personalized and effective women‚Äôs health routine. Keep up the great work!"
622,2,"I've had this app for a few years now, i love that it will tell me when my monthly is coming but I hate how it is constantly telling to sign up for a plan. Why give me the option to learn more about MY body but then turn around and put a price tage on it. 7.99 a month is crazy but 39.99 a year is too. Especially for a teenage girl who's just now learning everything. Like I want to learn more about me and my body without losing money."
623,5,love this app and the support team. I had an old email address I deleted that I had used to sign up for flo with and when I got a new phone I couldn't access my account!! fortunately however I'd used a different account to purchase premium with and support managed to merge the accounts so I could access my 2 years of data with!! they were so helpful and just lovely!!
624,2,"I've been using this app for about a decade now. It was the first app I downloaded to help me track my irregular periods. This app helped me communicate with my doctor and my partner better and helped me get insight into my body. At first, you could get information you could google for free now. You have to pay for the short articles or to be diagnosed. Every time I open the app, there is one less free feature."
625,2,Have been using this app for about two years or so. Used to be a really good app but now you cannot use most of the features without it pestering for you to buy their premium subscription. It seems that they have taken most of the insights and features away from the free download and want you to pay the subscription for them now.
626,2,"it's very good at tracking your period but the reason I downloaded the app, is locked behind a pay wall üòû. I wanted the advice features and how to deal with certain things as a teenager but you can't click on anything without it being included in the premium membership. I wish flo could make it more accessible for teens that most likely don't have money but still wants advice üòÖ"
627,1,"This app asks for preferences, whether you're in a relationship, sexually active, etc. and then promptly ignores all your preferences and shows you articles and notifications about the stuff you didn't ask for anyway. This, of course, is only after premium has been thrown in your face so many times you forget that this app even has a single free feature. Which it really doesn't, their chat bot can't finish a complete thought without pulling out the beggar routine. wouldn't recommend"
628,5,I originally wanted to use this so I could compare calendars with another app and I've only had it for like 2 days so far but I actually really love all the features. my Fianc√© is able to look at a lot more information than the other one I had and it asks a lot of questions. I'm about to find out if all the questions help with accurate information because this says my monthly is due tomorrow and my other one says a little under a week. I'll report back soon
629,5,"This app is truly amazing, had it since high school. I will give this app 5 stars if you guys added in the other forms of birth control that other women like myself have that might cause you not to have your period for a whole year or 2. I think that would be a game changer for you guys. Keep doing your thing ü§óüíï Edit: Nevermind, I just found those options in the app, 5 stars!!!"
630,2,"The app is pretty decent. I downloaded it just to track my period, so all the sex life and pregnancy tracking questions weren't the best thing to open the app to, and as a queer asexual person it was not very fun to be bombarded with all that. Especially since I'm fairly sure that all of those sex education were about straight sex. Which leads to my second critique of the app, without paying all the insights and articles are off limit. This app is pretty much just a period tracker with sex ads."
631,2,"This is a great app, with the major exception that this app really pushes the monthly or yearly subscription at every possible opportunity. If you don't want or can't afford the subscription, it's a real pain. I just want to track my cycle. It would be amazing if I could turn off the articles (most of which need a subscription to read). However, for tracking your period, this app is the best on the market (I've tried a fair number)."
632,4,"I've used this app for many years and love the prediction and analysis data and anonymous features. The bad is that while I understand the purpose of premium, I feel like it gets push way too frequently and caused me to use the app less (only for tracking). When they introduced the partner feature, it was so limited that my partner paid for the premium which then gave it to me. The partner feature is great but needs some work which I'll submit through their email."
633,1,"Used to be the best tracking app ever and I've been using it for the past 8-9 years. Unfortunately, it has been made clear that now they just care about money because half the things you used to be able to read/learn/do on the app now are hidden behind a paywall when they didn't use to be. Literally feel like I can't click anything without being told I need to have a subscription now. Finishing my pregnancy out with it just for tracking the weeks then switching to a different period tracker."
634,2,"if you're a free user this app is really annoying. they dont clearly state what is a premium feature, so you end up clicking on many things only to get a prompt to subscribe. I understand its a business and you need money. but all other apps show what's premium by using a star or crown icon on those features so you can make the decision for yourself if you want to click. this has given me a really negative view on the app even though the premium stuff looks really interesting bc I feel tricked"
635,4,"it's simple and I like the features they have, but almost all of them are behind a paywall except the symptoms tracker. don't expect much else from this app unless you plan on paying for it. And to be honest forcing people to pay for health education leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I'm not saying make the whole app free, but at least leave important/basic information available to everyone."
636,1,"EDIT:Still 1 ‚≠êÔ∏è.After being told there is a free version with a tracker & notifications, it took 5 tries to close out the subscription popup.I wasn't told all you can track is your period. I get notifications for other categories I expressed interest in, but can't access any w/o paying.Subscription popups are aggressive & constant.Free version should have access to most of the other features, even if limited to use, instead of forced to do a free trial.Bad way to gain customers.I hope it's fixed"
637,5,"One of the best period tracking apps. I have been using it for over a year or two and the predictions are so accurate, it's so helpful to know exactly what's going on with your body! The flo assistant insights are really helpful as well, the secret chat is a great feature too! Girl to girl conversations without the fear of judgement are so refreshing."
638,1,"I wanted to download a copy of my data. This is not an option in the app and you are required to contact the app support email. You only receive the same ""copy and paste"" AI generated responses via email from a 3rd party service when you attempt to contact their app support. Despite requesting a copy multiple times, Flo will not provide me with a full copy of my own period/fertility data!"
639,4,"overall very accurate. whether it be predicting how I'm going to feel or other things like that, it's very helpful. one thing I don't like is how you have to pay for half of the features. don't get me wrong, if a had the money I 100% would buy premium because it is definitely worth it, but I don't have the money so unfortunately I cant. Great app though, would recommend as a period tracked!"
640,3,"Have used this app for years. Over all I like it, easy to use/ view all the data you put in. Originally you had access to all of the extra information, slowly alot of it was blocked unless you paid. Now apart from your calander/ entering symptoms you can't view anything unless you pay and you get constant pop ups trying to get you to subscribe making 90% of the apps features redundant. Think i'll start hunting around for a new app now."
641,5,"For the most part great!! Love the app for so many reasons. The ""couples"" portion DEFINITELY needs work üò¨ Quiz answers are vague and limiting. ""none of the above"" or ""all of the above"" answers would be great. Even BETTER would be the option to type your own response, or ""choose all that apply"" options. Daily check ins for HER would also be beneficial. Daily check in answer options also need work and are very limiting. Developers!!! Help us!!!"
642,3,"The app is good, but costs too much. I bought it on sale for $20/yr; this is what I'd say it's worth, not the $60/yr they're asking for. I used it for my first pregnancy and it was informative enough. Helpful app once you get past the paywall. I'd buy it again for $20, but until then, it's useless because of the paywalls."
643,2,"I am so upset with the dark mode. I don't know who programmed it, or if anyone tested it before, but I can't see anything. Literally. The second you move to dark mode all the letters still stay white on a mostly white background. I now can't switch back to day mode or change theme, because I can't see where to click the button. It's a guessing game at this point It makes the app completely unusable. I am literally a few dead nerve endings away from deliting the app altogether"
644,5,"I have only been using Flo for a little while, but I have absolutely loved the experience. I think this app is really important and useful for girls, it helps them to understand their period and why their body may feel certain ways. it also gives you tips and tricks on beauty, and gets personal too. I think this app is amazing, especially because this is a good source to learn more about you and your periods."
645,5,Girl!! Tracking period Logging symptoms Get suggestions Keeping health logs Water tracking Partner linking You name it.... ‚≠êÔ∏è I have had this app for how long I don't remember. It has helped me keep my EVERYTHING on track since then. Definitely recommend it. But if it had more themes in black version I'd love that. ‚ú®Ô∏è. It feels like therapy when Logging in my periods üòÇ
646,3,"Pros: Best app for tracking period. It has many good features. and adding your (bf) partner is one such. cons: (needed improvement) - would be great if we can choose more symptoms like leg swelling, leg pain, chestache etc etc... - and need more discharge colors and textures... - It would be the best app ever if we include an option where our added partner can see about our symptoms, moods, and how heavy the flow is... (so atleast the üíö flag men will treat their gf better)"
647,4,"I love everything about this app. It's really accurate and it provides helpful tips and information. I wish the sync with google fit would work (sleep, period, weight) but for some reason at least for me it doesn't. It would also be very helpful if water intake and other stuff like that could be synced with apps like samsung health or health sync! Edit: A dark mode option would also be very helpful!"
648,2,"Money robbing!!! Hardly anything is free. Basically track your period, ovulation or pregnancy for free and everything else you need is behind a paywall Good app, great for tracking everything but I will say this app is terrible for the free option. You need more articles ect for free as not many people can afford the premium and some need the info but other than that, great app, very good with predictions!! I get you need to make some things money but not the whole app.. it's a joke"
649,5,"I have used flo for around 8 years or more I used it to get pregnant with my daughter(7) when my oldest son(10) was 2 even though I was in denial that I was even pregnant with her b/c with my son It took 10 years to get pregnant so this app does accurately predict the best day to concieve. It also has pregnancy mode and shows the growth of the baby, And now you can add your partner so they can see your fertility window, I 100% recommend , even if to just keep track of your cycle days."
650,4,"I absolutely love this app as it is quite accurate. 1 thing I can think of that they could do to improve the app is for it to allow u to add things to the symptoms, discharge, digestion and stool, mood, other and activity lists that it already gives u like my other app does which is actually awesome and helps make it easier to read and deal with as I instead have to add it to my notes üìù and Idk how accurately it adds those symptoms to my results."
651,3,It's an informative app but not as interactive for couples. I use it with my gf and all I get on my end is the ability to see her cycle days and ovulation windows. It would be nicer to have the ability to log her mood from my perspective if she wanted so she can get another person's input. That and other features to be logged by either person would be very useful in my opinion.
652,1,"I used to love this app. It used to provide information in the free version. I used to be able to customize it but it's just harsh white with pink text. Flo is just a glorified calendar. Tap literally any tab and it's behind a pay wall. Any topic at all. Pay wall. (And they really push the premium version in your face) It's actually frustrating. I used this app throughout my pregnancy but anything interesting I want to read, i have to pay for. It used to be convenient. I used to love Flo..."
653,3,"Very useful for recording symptoms from physical to emotional, but I can't in good conscience rate this app very high. When you record certain symptoms, the app will prompt a coded chat to assist, which is a good thing. The bad thing, however, is that many, many things are locked behind a premium plan, which is not clarified until you hit that point. It's really disheartening when the chats suggest an empathetic tone, then slip right into that ""try premium free!"" spiel."
654,2,"Bloated with repetitive and less than useful ""insights"" even on premium version. Chats seem to be full of bots making it tough to find relevant information. Not enough flexibility to deal with big changes to the cycle like PCOS. Basic tracking is algorithm based so works mostly ok if your body is consistent."
655,4,"overall the app is great, i just have a suggestion. while viewing weight chart, it shows the graph in intervals of a period cycle, it would be better if graph is continuous and not just divided into period cycles. a continuous graph will help us see how our weight is fluctuating not just for a period cycle but over time as well."
656,2,Flo is a great app. I transferred all my apps to my new phone and now it's not allowing me to get pass 'Choose your plan' all I'm seeing is reviews and it's frustrating that I can't get past it. I un-installed and reinstalled and I'm still having the same issue.
657,1,"It's been years and still no return of the dark themes that were removed and no new dark mode implemented, despite saying it would. Bit fed up of my retinas being singed every time I want to log a symptom or track my cycle. Edit: Not sure why dark mode is not available, it's 2024 almost every app has some form of dark mode implemented."
658,1,"Membership needed to access lots of content. Lots of features are presented to you but then locked by membership. Notification suggested its the best time to conceive yet first day of last period was 7 days ago? Which suggests the advice is very generic bordering on inaccurate. Too many features, notifications and membership pop ups that it's more hassle than it's worth to track my period."
659,1,"It's a very nice app. It worked well until I changed my device. After that, I haven't been able to access my account. I haven't been able to reach anyone from customer support. I paid for the year, so annoying. Update: Customer support finally reached out and there was no way to recover my info. The app is really nice, but it's unfortunate that something as common as changing a device will make you all the info you've been tracking."
660,5,"The app is designed perfectly for women. I've been using it for more than a year, and it helps me to track my irregular menstrual cycle. The prediction is quite accurate. So far, there's No better app than this one to help me gain the monthly insight about my own body. It's super easy to use, it definitely helpful for those who struggle with irregular menstrual cycle or those who want to get pregnant. Love this app so muchhh...."
661,2,"To who it may concern, Please come to my assistance. Earlier today I noticed I had been charged for a premium subscription and I don't remember authorising it. It doesn't show on my Google play, but my Flo account has now changed to premium. I have no order receipt, or record of the transaction on my Google account. Can you come to my assistance? This is expensive and I want to cancel the subscription, request a refund and go back to Flo basic. It's very frustrating trying to figure this out."
662,2,"Somewhat useful, I only use the free mode. The tracker is accurate for periods, Useless when you're pregnant. I get constant notifications which I can't turn off, most things that are recommended are locked behind a paywall. I can't change how far along I am so everything pushed at me is irrelevant and inaccessible. I'm so close to uninstalling purely because of the notification harassment."
663,4,"Have used the app for years and always paid for the premium account. I noticed the app changed my profile to track cycle and not get pregnant. When trying to change, the subscription goes up to ¬£44.99 instead of ¬£14.99 which it currently is. Also, I recently got the Oura ring which says it can connect to Flo. However it seems impossible. The instructions to connect don't match with the app and there is nowhere in Flo that mentions supporting apps."
664,1,"Free partner version is extremely simple, no added value rather than being able to track my partner's cycle on the calendar. The given advices are very superficial and doesn't align much. All that topped with extreme pushy approach on singing up for the paid version. Every time I open the app I have to skip to several ""stories"" about the paid verson to then open the app. Got access to anything in the app rather than the calendar and the ""advices"". Super limited n annoying! U guys can do better."
665,2,"The app itself is good. I like the functions and everything. The only problem is that whatever you click, it pops up that the function is only available with a subscription. Sometimes even if you don't click any paid function, ads still pop up. I realize the hard work etc. but it's starting to get really annoying and it's hard to use the app if everything is locked under a subscription, especially when the trial version is no longer available."
666,1,"Love the graphics, but that's about it. You literally can't use this app without subscribing to an overpriced plan. It's an obscene amount for what it does. Every pop-up and explanation is behind a subscription wall, and it doesn't even offer much more than a quick question to ChatGPT. For now I'll keep using the basic feature - tracking, but I wonder how long before even that is paid."
667,1,"Don't understand why people like it so much. SEVERAL times a day I get ridiculous notifications from this app telling me ""oh today you might feel like this!"" or ""expect to be more sad today"" among other things, and there isn't a single setting to be able to turn them off. I wanted a simple app that tracks my period and warns me a day or 2 in advance with notifications, but I can't turn off the notifications because then I will have no heads up about my period."
668,2,"I‚Äôve been a loyal user‚Äîpremium for four years and basic for more than five‚Äîand I used to love this app. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm now considering cancelling my premium subscription due to persistent bugs. I keep receiving notifications despite turning them off, and more importantly, the app no longer provides information about my cycle. With its core feature missing, it's hard to justify the subscription cost."
669,2,"Seems to be a great tracking app, but really not very LGBTIQA+ friendly. Usually I'm not one to mention this as I understand queer relationships are the minority, but this app could do so many small things to make it more inclusive. For example, just some slight terminology changes and the addition of a few more options in the daily tracking section would make a huge difference. Disappointing to have paid for an app which isn't built to be inclusive of my sexuality."
670,3,"Flo is a decent app and it is mostly accurate. Although accuracy is great, it is unbelievable that premium is the only way to learn additional important facts about my body. These simple features should be free, not $55.99 Canadian yearly. Even trying to understand possible period symptoms are under a premium plan. Honestly, if you are a person who wants to further educate yourself about womanly cycles, this app isn't the best option unless you would like to pay $55.99 a year or $10.99 a month."
671,1,"it's ok for tracking the cycle but first, it has a ton of unnecessary features, and second, any time I log out of the app, go log back it, I need to go THROW THE WHOLE VERY LONG ONBOARDING THAT YOU CAN'T SKIP. Wrote to support about it a couple years ago... they said it's skippable... some questions, yes, but why don't you just give registered users an option to log in directly??? and, to top this off, once I managed to log back in, my data wasn't even saved! Imma look for a new period tracker"
672,2,"I used Flo years ago, and recently came on to use it again to find that most of the app uses you are required to pay premium. The app prompts me to click on things, have daily discussions with assistance, and gives insights, all of which require premium. So I've flashed a bunch of things I can't use, totally put me off. I'd rather find an app that I can use the things shown to me without having to pay üôÉ"
673,1,"Keeps getting worse and worse with every update. Now it's really hard to see which cycle day it is and it just says ""period may start today"" for like 2 weeks. It also stopped predicting for next months!! I will check other similar apps and change. Shame after years of using Flo. Also super annoying how much it's pushing for paid subscription now. Nobody will pay for an app that keeps getting WORSE."
674,1,if I could rate it zero stars I would. I've never hated an app so much. firstly the free trial charges you before the trial period is up. secondly it constantly tells me my period is late and to do a pregnancy test. 1. it's not even close to being late and 2 I'm infertile. it's triggering as to see that notification constantly and not even be able to turn it off. As below I have emailed you awaiting a response.
675,1,"UI/UX has become so terrible for me, maybe for younger audience it's better this way but I'm always at a loss within the app. Exporting the data is overcomplicated as well so I ended up manually copying everything from several years to migrate. Would never use a service which doesn't have a clear export feature again, I don't feel like I own any data I have put in the app."
676,1,"It's so insane that they make everything so women positive, but if you want ANY useful features or ANY educational information you need premium. It's really so crazy. All you can do without premium is log the date, and for me the tracking isn't even accurate. The tracking is also manual not adapted to you personally. If you're gonna act so supportive, be so supportive."
677,1,"Annoying Because this app wipes your notes. now they added a feature that a couple days before your period it doesn't show likely ovulation dates after until you actually log your period. Which is very annoying because you cannot make tentative plans. It now adds two ""possible"" period dates to your estimated period and doesn't give you an option to leave it off. I left this app once before due to being inundated with ads and unsolicited pop ups about things I'm not interested in. Not coming back"
678,2,"You regularly give me some discount or 100 days streak ""gift"" but I am unable to open and see what is it. It keeps sending me on this page and nothing happens - it just opens Play store at you app and that's about it. That's annoying. And without payong there is literally no change even to put different email adress or anything it just bugs the whole phone if you try. I do have S24 ultra - it's quite fast for anything but this app when I try to get any of your gifts."
679,3,"I kinda like the app because it looks resourceful, been having it for 3 years now but I Uninstalled at a point because I couldn't find a use for it aside log period and read chats . like , what's the point of seeing resources and yet not being granted any access to them ? like, I really want to know if there's something you can READ or DO on Flo without necessarily paying for premium. Not everyone can pay for premium use of the app ,so at least quite a few stuff should be left accessible."
680,5,"One of the Best Period Tracking Apps! I've been using Flo for a while now, and it has truly made a difference in how I track and understand my cycle. The app is beautifully designed, easy to use, and extremely accurate with predictions. I love how it not only tracks periods and ovulation but also provides insightful articles, health tips, and reminders. It‚Äôs like having a mini health assistant in my pocket."
681,1,"Tried to pay for subscription as almost everything is behind a paywall but the verification page is faulty. Input fields for verification codes don't work, nothing comes up when trying to enter numerical data. App developers need to look into this as customers can't pay for subscriptions, surprised this was not caught through QA testing."
682,1,"It was a great app until I tried to cancel after having a baby and a hysterectomy. I've spent a year trying to figure it out and it turns out I had two subscriptions, they were charging me for both and I didn't want either. It feels like you have to click a 100 times to cancel and jump through flaming hoops of fire. And you are screwed of you forget your log in or switch from IPhone to android. An absolutely terrible experience and and expensive learning curve."
683,4,love all the info you get from it definitely worth it. the only thing I wish it had was a widget that tracks the days of your cycle like a count down to it. the only widget they have is to track the growth of your baby which is awesome but not all of us are pregnant. so now I have two period apps on my phone one with a widget that show the day of my cycle and when I'm ovulating and one with an insane amount of info one everything.
684,4,"very useful for your basic needs. only thing stopping me from 5 stars is that pretty much every single feature you need to have premium for. I don't mind that for some cos obviously they gotta make money somehow but I do wish a couple more features, particularly insights about my health could perhaps be part of the free package. still a very useful app though for tracking so definitely recommend for that"
685,1,"I am not ""active"" and it keeps giving me notifications trying to make me scared, for example, ""you're 2 days late! you're 5 days late! you're 7 days late!"" this is literally just a data farming app (it collects data so it knows when you're craving chocolate, then it shows you advertisements for chocolate) zero stars"
686,2,"used to use it just to track my cycle but honestly this is not a good app at all. way too many ads and advertisements of their own app ,in app - WHILE being subscribed to premium. you can't access your information offline either. the ""useful"" insight you get is 8th grade biology at best. probably better apps out there , definitely don't reccomend this one though. you're better off tracking on paper and a calendar. and the weird kinky sex forums are... questionable"
687,5,"The app is so good, BUT, since i can't upgrade to the premium version it becomes so annoying when they ask me to, like almost everything requires premium, there are apps that can do the free options in the app without nagging about the upgrade! Please give more freedom to the users of the free version. Thank you. Update: great app, thank you so much. Recommandation: I wish you can add changes in body temperature to the symptoms feature, because many women feel reallt cold or hot during period"
688,5,"Love this app! Very easy to use and the interface is easy to understand. I downloaded it for assistance in tracking my period and ovulation for family planning purposes. And now, with its help, I'm happily 17 weeks expecting as a first time mom ü•∞ So I've switched to its pregnancy tracker feature, which has also been helpful with tidbits of interesting information!"
689,5,"I was recommended Flo by a friend as I was having irregular periods after coming off contraception. After a few periods were logged the predictions have been pretty spot on, so I feel much more at ease knowing when my period will be. I really like this app and find it most useful!"
690,1,"re-download this app because i used to use it religiously, i switched over to samsung health when i got my new phone, but its just not the same, i re-downloaded & it charged me for a subscription the day i got it, when i never signed up for one, i just wanted the basic free version just too keep track of my body and my cycle.. $40 later !!!! i love the app itself. it's very accurate, but im very aggravated that this happened üò§"
691,5,"I recently started using the Flo app to track my periods and I‚Äôm really enjoying it so far! The app looks bright, friendly, and very easy to use. It lets me log my period dates, flow, moods, symptoms, and even daily feelings, which helps me understand my body better. Flo gives clear reminders for upcoming periods, fertile windows, and ovulation days, which is super helpful. There are lots of helpful health articles and tips related to women‚Äôs health and wellness."
692,2,"I am generally happy with this application and have been using it for years. the only reason I am giving it a low rating is in hopes that a developer can address an issue I gave recently been experiencing. The functionality that I ise daily is the contraceptive reminders, but as of late the reminders do not come everyday. they skip days at random which is extremely problematic"
693,3,"it's a great app for tracking my period, but also a total cash grab. I can't look at anything to learn or for advice without needing the premium feature. the app gives a bunch of free trials, but I feel like there should be more things you could be able to do without having to pay."
694,3,"Great app, but SO FREAKING BUSY. As soon as you open the app, the freaking Flo AI companion pops up every single time (I am not interested in this feature at all and cant find a way to turn it off), a million things try to update at once, and the entire interface is just TOO MUCH. Disorganized and chaotic. I really find this app incredibly frustrating to use and extremely overstimulating even when Im NOT having a menstrual-induced migraine. When I'm actually on my period, this app is unbearable."
695,3,"overall app does what I want it to do, let's me see my cycle so I can predict around when my period happens again. although I know subscriptions help keep the up running it is a bit weird to put stuff life ""finding out why your cycle is irregular"" behind it??? or information that can be very useful about periods behind that paywall."
696,5,"I really love this app and all the symptoms you can log to help you get to know your own cycle and what to expect. I have a request to add something to the symptoms if that's possible. It would be great for position of cervix (high/low) and firmness (soft/hard) to be added, as a lot of women track this whilst trying to conceive."
697,3,i gave this app a 5 star before because of the secret chats but recently they're not updating. i can see there are posts when i click on a tag but it's not showing up on my feed. my feed is filled with old posts like from 4 to 6 days ago. AND i don't think my own posts are being shown on others feed because i don't get any responses recently when i used to get so many instantly before. I've tried logging in and out and reinstalling but no use
698,1,I'm having issues logging back in since I got a new phone. When you put in my email which is registered the account I pay for it opened a new account. The new account does not include any of my saved information nor the subscription I pay for it. Can you please provide me with someone to contact in regard to how to fix this. In the meantime I'll be canceling my subscription. Signing in has been a pain and full of pop up after pop up after pop-up even once I do get to the login screen.
699,2,"It's a very misleading app. If you don't have premium (which I had, not worth it), it'll walk you through a ""conversation"" with an AI but when you get to the end of the conversation, it tells you that you need to pay to see the answers. If you just want to track your period, it's perfectly fine for that. But if you want to read articles or have questions about your period, just use google ladies. It's free and much quicker (and you don't have to have a painful conversation with an AI)."
700,5,I love this app & how it helps me keep track of my shark week every month but it is insane on how you have to pay for this app & it being so much is ridiculous for a tracker of my shark week when I can do so with a regular calendar & or my note & reminder on my cellphone... 20 something a month or more is just not a price range everyone can afford for this app & I think it should be free to a extent but still have the options of everything unless you wanted to upgrade .
701,1,"Awful app, barely works and when it does, they either sell your data or loose it (or both). Constant pop-ups and notifications begging to pay for the monthly subscription like it's their full time job. If you enjoy getting harrased to pay so they can mishandle your personal information, you'll love it. The ceo has the same vibes as the app, desperate and shady."
702,1,"For the longest time this app has really helped me and has been accurate in tracking my flow and ovulation days but of late I feel like it has a glitch. How is it possible for it to show me that I'm fertile a day after I receive my periods!!! It doesn't update my cycle and I can't see beyond two months,right now we're in August I can't see my cycle predictions beyond October. I thought my fertile period comes two weeks after my period but in the app it shows my fertile days are two days after p"
703,4,"[Edited] Thank you so much for the feedback and for giving premium subscription‚ù§Ô∏è However after I compare Flo with a few other cycle apps, Flo lacks the cycle phase info (such as luteal phase, etc.) Please add this feature so we could specifically know which cycle phase we're in. Also please add sickness symptoms tracker such as common cold or fever, etc. I've been using Flo for 7 years and I don't want to switch. Thank you! :)"
704,3,"frustrated by how much appears to be included in the ""free"" app, yet when clicked it just tries to get you to sign up to premium. At least put the locked symbol on the front so I know not to even bother trying to look at it!"
705,5,wonderful app. sometimes not everything syncs up completely that's a bit unfortunate when looking at the summary of the month. but otherwise still a very useful app and I would recommend it to everyone. even your partner can participate with his side of the app to check in on you and the cycle.
706,2,"took 20mins to gather tons of information about myself, get all the way to end and then they make you choose a subscription to be able to fully use the app! They should tell you that from the very beginning instead of going through all the personal info for setup then not being able to use unless you pay... why does everything have to cost something...atleast state it from the beginning don't withhold until the very end!!"
707,1,"Not about helping women but profiting off women. They don't let you extract your own data for medical tracking. I have PMDD, and having an app that tracked mental+physical symptoms seemed great. I paid full, & logged symptoms for 2 years to get data for diagnosis. Nope. They keep your data and it cannot be extracted. Now, they've got rid of other useful things to help manage hormonal challenges, like weight and sleep logs. 1/8/25: can't just login if on new device! make you walk through set upüò°"
708,2,"nothing special. The assumption and articles are not that useful. Everyday pregnancy symptoms are random: today's and tomorrow's will not be the same in the app, but they are the same in life. All the app is doing is calculating weeks of pregnancy. It could be free for only one useful feature."
709,4,great app love the tracking and daily insight! I only gave it a 4 star because i think the app is a bit pricey and now you cant even see the daily insights. I did pay for a year but not anymore to pricey i can just track it in my calendar. now that I'm pregnant i will just look for another app.
710,4,I appreciate that I can use the basic functions without a subscription while I am on a fixed income. The app is easy to use and intuitive to navigate and the design and layout are very clean. The only issue I've noticed is that occasionally it will not let me apply changes in the symptom tracker unless I close the app and restart it. Otherwise it functions without issue.
711,1,"Tedious, incredibly long and scrutinicious onboarding. It must be a joke. Also, you can't skip this superlong onboarding. I couldn't log in my account, because the app won't send the password recovery link to my email. 0/10. Excel is better, ladies"
712,3,"I'm a very new user (one week), so I've got a lot to observe, but I wish you could further personalize the articles and be able to suppress what you don't want to see. I'm not yet perimenopausal or trying to get pregnant, yet that takes up a lot of space on my landing page. Other than that, so far, so good."
713,1,"Crazy how Flo has changed over the years. There used to be some educational content for free users but now it's all fear-mongering with the info hidden behind a paywall which is a cruel concept tbh. I also feel like the period predictions aren't as good as they used to be, so it's kind of become useless to me. Switching to a different app with safer privacy, too. All Flo users should keep an eye on the class action."
714,3,"This app looks great, but for me it was not simple to use, rather annoying. To much repeatable questions about how do I feel and what desease did I have, etc. Tons of other options. I just wanted to use it for tracking my periods, that's all :)"
715,4,"I have the paid version, I really like it BUT I would like to be able to filter the calendar to see what days I had certain symptoms. I can only see them manually if I click on a specific day. It has predictions but what I need is my symptoms history (all the days in the past year or so I logged in those symptoms) for medical reasons. I hope they add this feature since this medical issue is one of the reasons I started using the app in the first place. Otherwise it's great, I really love it."
716,5,(Perfect app....for me.... It is easy to handle..) that was my review 6 years back.. I should write more I think..as a user from 2018 flo never disappointed me even once...now I understand my menstrual cycle a lot more... the cycle prediction is wow..I mean 100% precise in my case...I love this app and I suggested this to many girls I know...they are also happy with it ...Lots of love keep going ‚ù§Ô∏è
717,4,"its pretty good even just using the free version. visually appealing, interesting information, and fairly customizable. one thing i dont like - when you enter your weight it defaults to what your weight ""should"" be (bmi or something similar) for your height/gender, not your last recorded weight. makes me self conscious + avoid the feature altogether"
718,3,"it's a good app for tracking your period, but literally EVERYTHING else is hidden behind a pay wall like bye. With all the access we have to other free information, there's no point in paying that much for a period tracker app."
719,2,"overall, a good app. it helps me track when im on and when im off quite nicely. my problem is the fact that you have to be on premium to get good forms of information. i cant afford premium because im 13, but my parents dont tell me these things so if Flo could it would be nice. i dont have a credit card to do the free trial either, so its disappointing."
720,5,This app is very useful and very helpful to me. I've been using this for how many years until now. I recommend this to any other girls out there. You also need this app. You can track your period anytime and you would know what's happening in your body? if there's something wrong? and if you are advance or delayed? Also if you are forgetful you badly need this.
721,3,"it's fair. I get prompts in symptom tracker needing attention, suggesting PCOS, and prompts to get a yearly subscription in order to assess in APP. Only I already know I have PCOS, was diagnosed a decade ago. would be good to be able to put that info that does impact cycles and fertility, into the app by default."
722,1,"The boyfriend side of the app is a joke. Can't see what the partner logs, get spammed with notifications, and anything else is behind a pay wall. It basically just gives you the app's cycle track, which is worthless if you have minimum communication. Switching to Clue."
723,4,"I love this app, it's helps me track my periods and you can even chat with people on there too! but the only reason I didn't rate it 5 is because if you want to do additional things and access useful information about your period other than tracking it, you need premium and I can't pay for that so it's quite a pain to not be able to get ahold of the additional information about my Period when I need it. I just don't see the new point in charging people for useful info about their periods"
724,1,"Every tap on the app takes me to a ""Unlock Premium"" page. Without paying, it's just a calendar that won't let you read any insights/tips on fertility, pregnancy, moods, symptoms, etc. Other apps do much more for free."
725,5,Having an app that helps us track is amazing.... Just wish that the free version was not as limiting or that a tracking app wasn't so expensive. I understand it's a privilege... but the reason we needed isn't as much (lol)
726,1,I love this app BUT a long time ago the app asked me if I want a lifetime subscription for a one-time fee as a limited offer and I paid for it but now it still charges me a yearly fee. This was very surprising and not Okk in my opinion. Update: I really like the app but the subscriptions are deceiving. I already have a subscription after what happened earlier but if I change the goal of my profile I have to pay more??
727,3,"It makes you pay for AI conversations and other educational topics that I would like to learn about and explore. But overall, the app is pretty accurate on when my flow will start and is very helpful on the symptoms. Would recommend it, but if you want to learn more, you have to pay."
728,2,"its a helpful app but only for tracking, you have to pay for almost everything else, and a lot of information is blocked unless you're willing to spend a bunch, it pushes you to go for premium so much wich is also annoying and it asks a lot of questions but does nothing to help you with the information you give"
729,1,"instant uninstall. not only are they invasive by wanting to stalk your activity on your phone (literally anything you search or type that isn't related to them), but of course you have to pay for it. They're not medical professionals, so you might as well pay a stranger for their opinion. there's plenty of free and noninvasive apps out there"
730,2,"No notification settings in the partner app?? This service has some great features, but I don't care for all of them. I CERTAINLY don't care to be pinged by it 2-4 times a day. I can allow or disallow notifications from the permission settings on my phone, but I can't select which types of notifications I would like to receive or ignore. I care about what my wife is experiencing, not how I can fine-tune my diet to increase my reproductive health."
731,1,"Almost all of the information and features are behind a paywall. The sex and pregnancy stuff is shoved down my throat, I just want to track my periods. Not everyone is sexually active, and not everyone wants to be pregnant. Overhyped and not that useful. I'll be looking for a new tracker app or just go back to using my wall calendar."
732,3,"Works fine. Lots of unnecessary functions like 'secret chats' and is definitely limited options for symptom tracking compared to other apps, particularly for women trying to use the app to track perimenopause or menopause symptoms"
733,3,"Ising this for 2 yrs now, paid version for 1.5 yrs. I stopped paying bc I never got pregnant, & didnt want to keep trying at this point. It is an okay period tracker but my fitbit was closer to what my cycle is. The app has more options for symptoms & other tags that are really better than fitbit. You dont actually get doctors advice & the pop ?s are a waste of time. I can add my pd dates better than fitbit. Overall experience is ok. For me, fitbit is better."
734,2,It used to be free. Not sure how all of a sudden they want to charge for everything. That's the downside for me. It's almost impossible nowadays to just find a period tracker that does what you want without the hassle of buying or having a subscription.
735,5,"Flo really helps to track periods and very very helpful for pregnancy. I had tried other app during pregnancy but those were very difficult to understand and paid as well but thank god Flo was there it is easy to use, easy to understand and most important free as well. Its my favorite app for tracking."
736,4,I have been using this app for like 3 years and had no complain.... it was very convenient but for about a month or so i haven't been able to see any stories pr graphs articles secret chats nothing.... like its just plain log your period.... even after logging symptoms there's no longer any stories or articles coming up like earlier or chat Kindly help me with this
737,3,"its great but its also never accurate. im not going to spend that much money every month for consistent inaccuracies. ive been using flo since either 2019 or 2018 and my period has been wrong since day 1. also- pregnancy dates are always off, too, even though im well aware of the two times to the day I conceived."
738,5,"I don't usually leave reviews on apps and I realise a lot of people see the pay wall blocking a great deal of the content on this and dislike the app because of that. However, I have found the secret chats section on this genuinely very helpful. It had given me a place to turn to fellow women who non-judgementally have given me advice on my physical and mental health."
739,2,"Tracking within itself is functional and easy to understand. However, if you dont pay for the better version, then the usefulness of the app is lost. you can't read articles for free or track more than normal symptoms for free either."
740,2,"Good period tracker but I feel like showing me insights that are helpful but locked behind a paywall defeats the whole purpose. I'd gotten the app because hey, an app that provides help and tips with intimate health. I had no idea that the inisghts were locked behind the subscription, nor do I have money to spare monthly for one, so to me the app is just a nice looking tracker with a lot of helpful but inaccessible articles that bloat the app unless I pay."
741,4,"I love flo so much. It's been the only tracker to adapt to an irregular period cycle right away, which has been such a big help to me. I love all the chats with others going through similar things and I love that I'm able to share it all with my boyfriend on his phone. it makes our lives easier. however, I really wish it had a way to track how different birth controls are affecting you and track insertion dates for non pill options, and maybe a reminder when to book that Dr visit."
742,1,"Downloaded the app, only to be asked 3 million questions (some that had nothing to do with tracking ovulation), and then had to press some button on the screen for several seconds to ""commit"" to the app (super corny and annoying), only to then be told I had to pay yearly or monthly. The process is very tedious and frustrating. It doesn't matter what you click on on the app, if you haven't paid, you can't read anything. Frustrating and annoying experience. Uninstalling."
743,4,"Incredibly useful for tracking periods, as it adjusts to changes. I wish we could turn off, or skip parts of, the bot chat stuff. Its programming/information is too general and ultimately restrictive. I also would like more symptom options, even just an add your own that you can select again as needed. Thanks for the app!"
744,2,"I've had this app for about 5 years and really just used it to track my periods, which it is decent for. But over time, more and more features have been locked behind a paywall and I got very annoyed at the pop-ups telling me to buy a plan. The final straw was a bug that kept putting my symptoms on one day and my flow on the next, despite logging both on the same day. I just don't see the point in continuing to use an annoying and buggy app. I plan on tracking my periods on paper now."
745,1,"The only reason I still use this app is because it's been my tracking app for the last 8 years now. They keep taking away free features and making them only available with the paid subscription. I'm now pregnant again for the third time and now it won't even tell me anything other than how far along I am. Any insight it offers is no longer free! I have a feeling soon it won't even be free to use it at all. I would switch if it were easy to export my data into another app, but it's not."
746,2,"I loved this app, it was accurate and it allowed me to track my periods as well as my ovulation dates AND allowed me to monitor any abnormalities and as someone who has always had very irregular periods it was great. However now they want me to pay for all the things that made it great and I can no longer monitor for any issues like I used to without paying?! As women we are already nickel and dimed for items like pads and I might as well just go back to using a calendar if all I get is tracking"
747,2,"Some of the couples quizzes and information are kinda nice but as a period tracker couple sharing app it's terrible. She puts all her information in in detail and I get practically none of that information on my side even though that was our intention. There is no setting to change it either, it's locked away. I would understand if it was a privacy thing for some couples but it should be an option in her settings not locked away for everyone."
748,1,"Great for period tracking. Before pregnancy 5 star. Postpartum, more like a 1 star app. Now it seems the app is struggling. The calendar knows I was pregnant but does not take into account postpartum or breastfeeding. Just wish there was an option to put in breastfeeding and postpartum, so it's not constantly trying to tell me something is wrong with my cycle."
749,2,"It's nice to be able to track my period but instead of grabbing a pen and paper to do that I downloaded this because with how much is in the app I thought there would be more for free then just a period calendar. I expected understand and insights, and yet everything little thing I clicked on I had to pay for. The thing is, is that I would have paid for it if there was a bit more for free. This app wasn't created to help it was created for self purposes. nothing on here to help is for free."
750,3,"I've been using Flo for 5+ years, and it has been mostly great. Flo can predict my period often down to the day, and is helpful for tracking ovulation. Unfortunately in more recent years, they have progressively gotten rid of a lot of the free features that used to be included (such as evaluation chats, and articles), that now you have to pay for premium to use. It feels like everything that would be helpful to use to learn more about your cycle, they want you to have premium to access."
751,2,I wanna give it more stars become it is the best when it comes to tracking and getting tips and tricks for anything but I'm saying two stars because you only have access to like two things unless you pay. it's ridiculously expensive. why the heck do we have to pay for a pregnancy tracker or a health tracker in general. if we need the help and guidance it should be free our health shouldn't come with a cost. it's literally useless app without premium. please do something I loved this app
752,3,"I used to really like the app because for the free verison, yoi still got some knowledge about things you log or when you're pregnant, really helpful info about the baby as it grows. I got a new phone and couldn't access my account wasn't a big deal, bc I just made a new one, but now I cant acces I was able b4 other than logging my symptoms or settings. I can't look pretty much anything on the app bc it just puts me on page to buy the premium option. Im even locked out from the calendar."
753,3,"overall balanced app. 1 big nit pick is how you enter your weight. maybe some find having to spin and spin the weight wheele pleasing, I do not. if you could just tap and enter it like most other apps I would be more inclined to increase the rating. the other thing I noticed is that the overall design is simple but almost lacks in esthetic. back ground options, better/ more intricate designs. something of that nature would be awesome. these 2 things would add a star each in my opinion."
754,2,"it used to be a great app for tracking my period. once I paid for premium all it does is send me ads to renew which is so annoying. Whenever the app has a glitch and I have to reinstall it, it takes 15 mins to skip all of the questions,log back into my account. All of the information it had about pregnancy was inaccurate. The estimated sizes didn't match anything that I sourced from other sites, plus considering I was paying a premium for the feature the BUMP was free, accurate with 3D images."
755,4,"Overall great experience with this app. There are a few selections I'd love to see added. I had to stop birth control (after 16 years) for health reasons, and I wanted to keep track of my cycle as my body regulated, and so I could reduce my chances of getting pregnant, but that's not an option when asked why I got the app. I also use this as a mood/general well-being tracker, and noting how much quality sleep I got the night before would be super helpful to spot patterns there."
756,1,"This app is seriously one of those that are only out there for whatever they can get from whatever sucker is naive enough to sign up for my free trial. Most apps/companies have no problem refunding you- especially if it's within 5 minutes of being charged and reaching out to their customer service. They charged me at midnight, hoping I would not see, but I did. I find their services useless, that's why I deleted it a day after I downloaded it, I just forgot to cancel my subscription. üö´‚ùåüö´"
757,1,"I answered a million questions only to be told I had to pay a subscription for the data analysis. I declined and then got a message saying ""befire you start, we have a gift for you"". I clicked on it to find out that it was just a discounted yearly subscription. Even though I had not gotten a subscription, there was a box on my home page saying ""today's chance of pregnancy"" with a tick underneath but when I clicked, I was taken to the page of different subscriptions."
758,2,I had this app years ago and loved it so decided to download it again a couple of months ago. I'm disappointed in the amount of times I'm being asked to pay for a subscription. I used this app before with very minimal ads and there was no pressure to pay for premium. And now I can't escape the pop-ups multiple times just by opening the app I find myself just ignoring it and not actually using it because you're constantly being pushed to buy l.
759,1,dislike it. you have to subscribe and pay to view the simplest things on the app. not worth it unless you pay. the max you can do there is just tract your cycle. you can't use anything else mor read anything on there unless you pay. get another app that can help you and an app where you can do much more. this is not worth it. if you don't want to pay every month. and it's pretty expensive too when other apps offer so much more without paying.
760,1,"Edit 2025: my last review was complaining about the constant pop-ups and chats, that would only be useful if I paid for premium. I don't need them, anyway. Recently I got a new phone, and all of my tracking data for the last 2 years disappeared. So, I'm starting from scratch. I only need this to track my phases, which it can barely do, apparently. Will probably just transition to my Fitbit app exclusively, since it still has all my data from 2018 no problem."
761,1,"I've used the app for 9 years or so. App is only good for basic tracking unless you want to pay extra, I can do that on a paper calendar. The amount of stuff behind a pay wall is ridiculous and out of hand. I'm officially going to start looking for a different app. plus the data leaks? no thanks."
762,1,"I enjoyed using this app and it was always somewhat accurate but it kicked me out of my account for no reason. i switched phones and tried signing back in but it wont accept my email or password (which i know is correct) and when I tried to send reset instructions to my email, it won't send. this is all right after I finally caved and paid for the subscription. Now I can't even access the app."
763,1,"I have been apart of Flo since it's release and it's so sad to see the money grab app it's turned into today. Some of us use this app just to stay organized about the changes in our cycles, now you can't even open the app or navigate through it without a pop up begging for money. If I didn't only use it 5 days out of the month or didn't have 10 years worth of data stored I'd probably switch apps. Plus there's a whole class action lawsuit going on so that's fun!"
764,4,Great app! Very helpful! Just wish it weren't so pushy with premium. Everytime I go into the app it sends me a pop-up asking me to talk about how I feel because of that time. I try to ignore it but I really wish I could turn off those pop-ups. Other than that it's a solid period tracker. Even for my irregular cycles.
765,3,"I've used this app for 6+ years and I really loved it. unfortunately for the past year or two the app has been fairly glitchy for me. It no longer saves my logged periods to the point it's telling me I'm over a year late. it fails to predict cycle dates too. finally having to let this app go, which is sad as I've used it with all of my pregnancies."
766,2,"it was wonderful for years until now. the most essential features are officially only accessible via payment. tracking is useless to me now with all the information essentially being held hostage with a price point. five years ago, it was awesome. all the information was generally free. now with the most basic feature (fertility prediction and chances of conception) locked up and only being able to track *symptoms* I have grown to hate this once lovable and arguably essential tool."
767,2,"I used this app free for years and was happy with it's basic prediction functions, but recently I switched phones and all my data was lost. The login feature is totally broken and no matter which option I choose it takes me to an error page. I guess I won't miss the constant push for premium now that I've switched to a new app."
768,5,This app is great for tracking and predicting your period. I really like that you can change the focus based on your goals like getting pregnant or just simply tracking your cycle. I use the app all the time to plan trips. There are also some good articles and recommendations from professionals in the app. I would recommend this app.
769,3,this app could be awesome if there was a bit more inclusivity. I want to track my hormonal cycles while I have an IUD and there's no options without actively bleeding. there's also no entries for some of my regular symptoms and it is 99% centered around pregnancy and ovulation. theres a lot more to women's hormonal health and cycles and I would love to see an app like this that wasn't targeted at women trying to get pregnant or avoid getting pregnant.
770,3,"App is great for tracking moods, periods, and many other symptoms that helped me understand my body better. I had premium for a year or two and the advice didn't really change or was specifically tailored to me. I stopped premium and now when I click on content I'm not allowed to see anything, even though I thought some of it was basic health knowledge."
771,3,"I like Flo and have been using it for years. There's a few things that could be improved, though. #1, Paywall; having the insights behind a paywall is nonsense. Offer them as a one-time low-cost payment to have access if need be. #2, the constant pop-up to subscribe; this is beyond annoying. #3, no sign-in after a reinstall; having to go through that whole questionnaire process again is frustrating & time consuming. #4 Subscription cost; absolutely ridiculous for a period tracker app."
772,1,"worst tracking app. I'm so tired of getting asked for money. Especially when most of the ""advice"" or reasoning for things can be simply googled. Thought it would be convenient to have an app that has it all in one place, but paying for that is outrageous and comical. And usually I have no issue with apps that have a subscription, to each their own if they want to pay for a membership, don't care. But there is no touching anything on the app without the dang pop up to pay"
773,4,"update: had to re-login after getting a new phone and there needs to be an option to login before the long intro sequence. The intro should also just be fully skippable, and I could do without the ""long press"" to set my intentions. While I appreciate the personalization, forcing us to click through feels condescending. It's up to me why I use this app, that's the whole point. The process is enough to scare off new users as well. I've used flo for a long time, but these changes give me pause."
774,2,"it's fine for tracking periods, but it won't stop shoving a subscription in your face. It feels like every time you open the app, every time you click on something, read something, close something, it has to ask if you want to buy a subscription. It gets real annoying real fast. There are probably better tracker apps out there tbh."
775,2,"This app has a hard time with my irregular periods. When I log a period it doesn't always restart my cycle. Because of that, it often tells me to take pregnancy tests when I know I'm not pregnant. That chat bot conversations aren't very informative or personalized. I regret paying for the app for a year. I can see how it'd be useful for someone with more regular periods."
776,1,"I stopped paying for it when they started to give false biology. the app does nothing special other than track your pregnancy and period while looking pretty. other than that it prohibits the basic free information you can get from Google unless you pay for it to be shown on the app, there are several free apps that provide way more accurate information and articles without making a subscription. everything in the app is achievable for free."
777,4,"it's a very good tracker, and most of my periods have been right on track, I appreciate they allow a free trial, which is great, and I understand this can't be free but most things are restricted the only thing you can really do is track and chat with strangers but sometimes its not that helpful, Not everyone has money for it, and I think a simple solution is to allow at least 3 free articles, but this is just a recommendation."
778,2,"I believe the app would be really great If not for the constant asking to pay for the subscription. A reminder from time to time is fine, but it's a little overwhelming when it's done too much. A change in that direction would definitely make people more eager to actually consider the payment, while now it just gets annoying instead of encouraging."
779,1,"This app will let you open the app without creating an account. If you have to replace your phone or app is removed, you will never get your medical data back. The yrs of logging your data is just gone. If you remember info and want to back log, you can't. I'm very disappointed with how they can not pull up my account, even after sending proof of payment from my email. I'm pregnant right now and had important info in notes. Save your time and go somewhere else."
780,2,"It's advertised as one of the best ""free"" period tracking apps (which is why I downloaded), but every touchpoint is interrupted by a pay wall. It will waste your time with seemingly ""complimentary"" features only to hit you with the credit card request 20 questions in. Super annoying. would love a suggestion for an alternative. I think if you're trying to get pregnant it makes sense to pay, but it's annoying they advertise so much as a ""free"" platform when that tier is REALLY annoying to use"
781,4,"The app is great and really helped me understand my body and menstrual cycle better. One suggestion: please consider recording menstrual days based on the exact time it starts (e.g. 9 PM) instead of counting it as a full day. Also, it would be better if we get to track the amount of exercise, vaginal discharge, and sleep hours. These details can support a more personalized and effective women‚Äôs health routine. Keep up the great work!"
782,2,"I've had this app for a few years now, i love that it will tell me when my monthly is coming but I hate how it is constantly telling to sign up for a plan. Why give me the option to learn more about MY body but then turn around and put a price tage on it. 7.99 a month is crazy but 39.99 a year is too. Especially for a teenage girl who's just now learning everything. Like I want to learn more about me and my body without losing money."
783,5,love this app and the support team. I had an old email address I deleted that I had used to sign up for flo with and when I got a new phone I couldn't access my account!! fortunately however I'd used a different account to purchase premium with and support managed to merge the accounts so I could access my 2 years of data with!! they were so helpful and just lovely!!
784,2,"I've been using this app for about a decade now. It was the first app I downloaded to help me track my irregular periods. This app helped me communicate with my doctor and my partner better and helped me get insight into my body. At first, you could get information you could google for free now. You have to pay for the short articles or to be diagnosed. Every time I open the app, there is one less free feature."
785,2,Have been using this app for about two years or so. Used to be a really good app but now you cannot use most of the features without it pestering for you to buy their premium subscription. It seems that they have taken most of the insights and features away from the free download and want you to pay the subscription for them now.
786,2,"it's very good at tracking your period but the reason I downloaded the app, is locked behind a pay wall üòû. I wanted the advice features and how to deal with certain things as a teenager but you can't click on anything without it being included in the premium membership. I wish flo could make it more accessible for teens that most likely don't have money but still wants advice üòÖ"
787,1,"This app asks for preferences, whether you're in a relationship, sexually active, etc. and then promptly ignores all your preferences and shows you articles and notifications about the stuff you didn't ask for anyway. This, of course, is only after premium has been thrown in your face so many times you forget that this app even has a single free feature. Which it really doesn't, their chat bot can't finish a complete thought without pulling out the beggar routine. wouldn't recommend"
788,5,I originally wanted to use this so I could compare calendars with another app and I've only had it for like 2 days so far but I actually really love all the features. my Fianc√© is able to look at a lot more information than the other one I had and it asks a lot of questions. I'm about to find out if all the questions help with accurate information because this says my monthly is due tomorrow and my other one says a little under a week. I'll report back soon
789,5,"This app is truly amazing, had it since high school. I will give this app 5 stars if you guys added in the other forms of birth control that other women like myself have that might cause you not to have your period for a whole year or 2. I think that would be a game changer for you guys. Keep doing your thing ü§óüíï Edit: Nevermind, I just found those options in the app, 5 stars!!!"
790,2,"The app is pretty decent. I downloaded it just to track my period, so all the sex life and pregnancy tracking questions weren't the best thing to open the app to, and as a queer asexual person it was not very fun to be bombarded with all that. Especially since I'm fairly sure that all of those sex education were about straight sex. Which leads to my second critique of the app, without paying all the insights and articles are off limit. This app is pretty much just a period tracker with sex ads."
791,2,"This is a great app, with the major exception that this app really pushes the monthly or yearly subscription at every possible opportunity. If you don't want or can't afford the subscription, it's a real pain. I just want to track my cycle. It would be amazing if I could turn off the articles (most of which need a subscription to read). However, for tracking your period, this app is the best on the market (I've tried a fair number)."
792,4,"I've used this app for many years and love the prediction and analysis data and anonymous features. The bad is that while I understand the purpose of premium, I feel like it gets push way too frequently and caused me to use the app less (only for tracking). When they introduced the partner feature, it was so limited that my partner paid for the premium which then gave it to me. The partner feature is great but needs some work which I'll submit through their email."
793,1,"Used to be the best tracking app ever and I've been using it for the past 8-9 years. Unfortunately, it has been made clear that now they just care about money because half the things you used to be able to read/learn/do on the app now are hidden behind a paywall when they didn't use to be. Literally feel like I can't click anything without being told I need to have a subscription now. Finishing my pregnancy out with it just for tracking the weeks then switching to a different period tracker."
794,2,"if you're a free user this app is really annoying. they dont clearly state what is a premium feature, so you end up clicking on many things only to get a prompt to subscribe. I understand its a business and you need money. but all other apps show what's premium by using a star or crown icon on those features so you can make the decision for yourself if you want to click. this has given me a really negative view on the app even though the premium stuff looks really interesting bc I feel tricked"
795,4,"it's simple and I like the features they have, but almost all of them are behind a paywall except the symptoms tracker. don't expect much else from this app unless you plan on paying for it. And to be honest forcing people to pay for health education leaves a sour taste in my mouth. I'm not saying make the whole app free, but at least leave important/basic information available to everyone."
796,1,"EDIT:Still 1 ‚≠êÔ∏è.After being told there is a free version with a tracker & notifications, it took 5 tries to close out the subscription popup.I wasn't told all you can track is your period. I get notifications for other categories I expressed interest in, but can't access any w/o paying.Subscription popups are aggressive & constant.Free version should have access to most of the other features, even if limited to use, instead of forced to do a free trial.Bad way to gain customers.I hope it's fixed"
797,5,"One of the best period tracking apps. I have been using it for over a year or two and the predictions are so accurate, it's so helpful to know exactly what's going on with your body! The flo assistant insights are really helpful as well, the secret chat is a great feature too! Girl to girl conversations without the fear of judgement are so refreshing."
798,1,"I wanted to download a copy of my data. This is not an option in the app and you are required to contact the app support email. You only receive the same ""copy and paste"" AI generated responses via email from a 3rd party service when you attempt to contact their app support. Despite requesting a copy multiple times, Flo will not provide me with a full copy of my own period/fertility data!"
799,4,"overall very accurate. whether it be predicting how I'm going to feel or other things like that, it's very helpful. one thing I don't like is how you have to pay for half of the features. don't get me wrong, if a had the money I 100% would buy premium because it is definitely worth it, but I don't have the money so unfortunately I cant. Great app though, would recommend as a period tracked!"
800,3,"Have used this app for years. Over all I like it, easy to use/ view all the data you put in. Originally you had access to all of the extra information, slowly alot of it was blocked unless you paid. Now apart from your calander/ entering symptoms you can't view anything unless you pay and you get constant pop ups trying to get you to subscribe making 90% of the apps features redundant. Think i'll start hunting around for a new app now."
801,5,"For the most part great!! Love the app for so many reasons. The ""couples"" portion DEFINITELY needs work üò¨ Quiz answers are vague and limiting. ""none of the above"" or ""all of the above"" answers would be great. Even BETTER would be the option to type your own response, or ""choose all that apply"" options. Daily check ins for HER would also be beneficial. Daily check in answer options also need work and are very limiting. Developers!!! Help us!!!"
802,3,"The app is good, but costs too much. I bought it on sale for $20/yr; this is what I'd say it's worth, not the $60/yr they're asking for. I used it for my first pregnancy and it was informative enough. Helpful app once you get past the paywall. I'd buy it again for $20, but until then, it's useless because of the paywalls."
803,2,"I am so upset with the dark mode. I don't know who programmed it, or if anyone tested it before, but I can't see anything. Literally. The second you move to dark mode all the letters still stay white on a mostly white background. I now can't switch back to day mode or change theme, because I can't see where to click the button. It's a guessing game at this point It makes the app completely unusable. I am literally a few dead nerve endings away from deliting the app altogether"
804,5,"I have only been using Flo for a little while, but I have absolutely loved the experience. I think this app is really important and useful for girls, it helps them to understand their period and why their body may feel certain ways. it also gives you tips and tricks on beauty, and gets personal too. I think this app is amazing, especially because this is a good source to learn more about you and your periods."
805,5,Girl!! Tracking period Logging symptoms Get suggestions Keeping health logs Water tracking Partner linking You name it.... ‚≠êÔ∏è I have had this app for how long I don't remember. It has helped me keep my EVERYTHING on track since then. Definitely recommend it. But if it had more themes in black version I'd love that. ‚ú®Ô∏è. It feels like therapy when Logging in my periods üòÇ
806,3,"Pros: Best app for tracking period. It has many good features. and adding your (bf) partner is one such. cons: (needed improvement) - would be great if we can choose more symptoms like leg swelling, leg pain, chestache etc etc... - and need more discharge colors and textures... - It would be the best app ever if we include an option where our added partner can see about our symptoms, moods, and how heavy the flow is... (so atleast the üíö flag men will treat their gf better)"
807,4,"I love everything about this app. It's really accurate and it provides helpful tips and information. I wish the sync with google fit would work (sleep, period, weight) but for some reason at least for me it doesn't. It would also be very helpful if water intake and other stuff like that could be synced with apps like samsung health or health sync! Edit: A dark mode option would also be very helpful!"
808,2,"Money robbing!!! Hardly anything is free. Basically track your period, ovulation or pregnancy for free and everything else you need is behind a paywall Good app, great for tracking everything but I will say this app is terrible for the free option. You need more articles ect for free as not many people can afford the premium and some need the info but other than that, great app, very good with predictions!! I get you need to make some things money but not the whole app.. it's a joke"
809,5,"I have used flo for around 8 years or more I used it to get pregnant with my daughter(7) when my oldest son(10) was 2 even though I was in denial that I was even pregnant with her b/c with my son It took 10 years to get pregnant so this app does accurately predict the best day to concieve. It also has pregnancy mode and shows the growth of the baby, And now you can add your partner so they can see your fertility window, I 100% recommend , even if to just keep track of your cycle days."
810,4,"I absolutely love this app as it is quite accurate. 1 thing I can think of that they could do to improve the app is for it to allow u to add things to the symptoms, discharge, digestion and stool, mood, other and activity lists that it already gives u like my other app does which is actually awesome and helps make it easier to read and deal with as I instead have to add it to my notes üìù and Idk how accurately it adds those symptoms to my results."
811,3,It's an informative app but not as interactive for couples. I use it with my gf and all I get on my end is the ability to see her cycle days and ovulation windows. It would be nicer to have the ability to log her mood from my perspective if she wanted so she can get another person's input. That and other features to be logged by either person would be very useful in my opinion.
812,1,"I used to love this app. It used to provide information in the free version. I used to be able to customize it but it's just harsh white with pink text. Flo is just a glorified calendar. Tap literally any tab and it's behind a pay wall. Any topic at all. Pay wall. (And they really push the premium version in your face) It's actually frustrating. I used this app throughout my pregnancy but anything interesting I want to read, i have to pay for. It used to be convenient. I used to love Flo..."
813,3,"Very useful for recording symptoms from physical to emotional, but I can't in good conscience rate this app very high. When you record certain symptoms, the app will prompt a coded chat to assist, which is a good thing. The bad thing, however, is that many, many things are locked behind a premium plan, which is not clarified until you hit that point. It's really disheartening when the chats suggest an empathetic tone, then slip right into that ""try premium free!"" spiel."
814,2,"Bloated with repetitive and less than useful ""insights"" even on premium version. Chats seem to be full of bots making it tough to find relevant information. Not enough flexibility to deal with big changes to the cycle like PCOS. Basic tracking is algorithm based so works mostly ok if your body is consistent."
815,4,"overall the app is great, i just have a suggestion. while viewing weight chart, it shows the graph in intervals of a period cycle, it would be better if graph is continuous and not just divided into period cycles. a continuous graph will help us see how our weight is fluctuating not just for a period cycle but over time as well."
816,2,Flo is a great app. I transferred all my apps to my new phone and now it's not allowing me to get pass 'Choose your plan' all I'm seeing is reviews and it's frustrating that I can't get past it. I un-installed and reinstalled and I'm still having the same issue.
817,1,"It's been years and still no return of the dark themes that were removed and no new dark mode implemented, despite saying it would. Bit fed up of my retinas being singed every time I want to log a symptom or track my cycle. Edit: Not sure why dark mode is not available, it's 2024 almost every app has some form of dark mode implemented."
818,1,"Membership needed to access lots of content. Lots of features are presented to you but then locked by membership. Notification suggested its the best time to conceive yet first day of last period was 7 days ago? Which suggests the advice is very generic bordering on inaccurate. Too many features, notifications and membership pop ups that it's more hassle than it's worth to track my period."
819,1,"It's a very nice app. It worked well until I changed my device. After that, I haven't been able to access my account. I haven't been able to reach anyone from customer support. I paid for the year, so annoying. Update: Customer support finally reached out and there was no way to recover my info. The app is really nice, but it's unfortunate that something as common as changing a device will make you all the info you've been tracking."
820,5,"The app is designed perfectly for women. I've been using it for more than a year, and it helps me to track my irregular menstrual cycle. The prediction is quite accurate. So far, there's No better app than this one to help me gain the monthly insight about my own body. It's super easy to use, it definitely helpful for those who struggle with irregular menstrual cycle or those who want to get pregnant. Love this app so muchhh...."
821,2,"To who it may concern, Please come to my assistance. Earlier today I noticed I had been charged for a premium subscription and I don't remember authorising it. It doesn't show on my Google play, but my Flo account has now changed to premium. I have no order receipt, or record of the transaction on my Google account. Can you come to my assistance? This is expensive and I want to cancel the subscription, request a refund and go back to Flo basic. It's very frustrating trying to figure this out."
822,2,"Somewhat useful, I only use the free mode. The tracker is accurate for periods, Useless when you're pregnant. I get constant notifications which I can't turn off, most things that are recommended are locked behind a paywall. I can't change how far along I am so everything pushed at me is irrelevant and inaccessible. I'm so close to uninstalling purely because of the notification harassment."
823,4,"Have used the app for years and always paid for the premium account. I noticed the app changed my profile to track cycle and not get pregnant. When trying to change, the subscription goes up to ¬£44.99 instead of ¬£14.99 which it currently is. Also, I recently got the Oura ring which says it can connect to Flo. However it seems impossible. The instructions to connect don't match with the app and there is nowhere in Flo that mentions supporting apps."
824,1,"Free partner version is extremely simple, no added value rather than being able to track my partner's cycle on the calendar. The given advices are very superficial and doesn't align much. All that topped with extreme pushy approach on singing up for the paid version. Every time I open the app I have to skip to several ""stories"" about the paid verson to then open the app. Got access to anything in the app rather than the calendar and the ""advices"". Super limited n annoying! U guys can do better."
825,2,"The app itself is good. I like the functions and everything. The only problem is that whatever you click, it pops up that the function is only available with a subscription. Sometimes even if you don't click any paid function, ads still pop up. I realize the hard work etc. but it's starting to get really annoying and it's hard to use the app if everything is locked under a subscription, especially when the trial version is no longer available."
826,1,"Love the graphics, but that's about it. You literally can't use this app without subscribing to an overpriced plan. It's an obscene amount for what it does. Every pop-up and explanation is behind a subscription wall, and it doesn't even offer much more than a quick question to ChatGPT. For now I'll keep using the basic feature - tracking, but I wonder how long before even that is paid."
827,1,"Don't understand why people like it so much. SEVERAL times a day I get ridiculous notifications from this app telling me ""oh today you might feel like this!"" or ""expect to be more sad today"" among other things, and there isn't a single setting to be able to turn them off. I wanted a simple app that tracks my period and warns me a day or 2 in advance with notifications, but I can't turn off the notifications because then I will have no heads up about my period."
828,2,"I‚Äôve been a loyal user‚Äîpremium for four years and basic for more than five‚Äîand I used to love this app. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm now considering cancelling my premium subscription due to persistent bugs. I keep receiving notifications despite turning them off, and more importantly, the app no longer provides information about my cycle. With its core feature missing, it's hard to justify the subscription cost."
829,2,"Seems to be a great tracking app, but really not very LGBTIQA+ friendly. Usually I'm not one to mention this as I understand queer relationships are the minority, but this app could do so many small things to make it more inclusive. For example, just some slight terminology changes and the addition of a few more options in the daily tracking section would make a huge difference. Disappointing to have paid for an app which isn't built to be inclusive of my sexuality."
830,3,"Flo is a decent app and it is mostly accurate. Although accuracy is great, it is unbelievable that premium is the only way to learn additional important facts about my body. These simple features should be free, not $55.99 Canadian yearly. Even trying to understand possible period symptoms are under a premium plan. Honestly, if you are a person who wants to further educate yourself about womanly cycles, this app isn't the best option unless you would like to pay $55.99 a year or $10.99 a month."
831,1,"it's ok for tracking the cycle but first, it has a ton of unnecessary features, and second, any time I log out of the app, go log back it, I need to go THROW THE WHOLE VERY LONG ONBOARDING THAT YOU CAN'T SKIP. Wrote to support about it a couple years ago... they said it's skippable... some questions, yes, but why don't you just give registered users an option to log in directly??? and, to top this off, once I managed to log back in, my data wasn't even saved! Imma look for a new period tracker"
832,2,"I used Flo years ago, and recently came on to use it again to find that most of the app uses you are required to pay premium. The app prompts me to click on things, have daily discussions with assistance, and gives insights, all of which require premium. So I've flashed a bunch of things I can't use, totally put me off. I'd rather find an app that I can use the things shown to me without having to pay üôÉ"
833,1,"Keeps getting worse and worse with every update. Now it's really hard to see which cycle day it is and it just says ""period may start today"" for like 2 weeks. It also stopped predicting for next months!! I will check other similar apps and change. Shame after years of using Flo. Also super annoying how much it's pushing for paid subscription now. Nobody will pay for an app that keeps getting WORSE."
834,1,if I could rate it zero stars I would. I've never hated an app so much. firstly the free trial charges you before the trial period is up. secondly it constantly tells me my period is late and to do a pregnancy test. 1. it's not even close to being late and 2 I'm infertile. it's triggering as to see that notification constantly and not even be able to turn it off. As below I have emailed you awaiting a response.
835,1,"UI/UX has become so terrible for me, maybe for younger audience it's better this way but I'm always at a loss within the app. Exporting the data is overcomplicated as well so I ended up manually copying everything from several years to migrate. Would never use a service which doesn't have a clear export feature again, I don't feel like I own any data I have put in the app."
836,1,"It's so insane that they make everything so women positive, but if you want ANY useful features or ANY educational information you need premium. It's really so crazy. All you can do without premium is log the date, and for me the tracking isn't even accurate. The tracking is also manual not adapted to you personally. If you're gonna act so supportive, be so supportive."
837,1,"Annoying Because this app wipes your notes. now they added a feature that a couple days before your period it doesn't show likely ovulation dates after until you actually log your period. Which is very annoying because you cannot make tentative plans. It now adds two ""possible"" period dates to your estimated period and doesn't give you an option to leave it off. I left this app once before due to being inundated with ads and unsolicited pop ups about things I'm not interested in. Not coming back"
838,2,"You regularly give me some discount or 100 days streak ""gift"" but I am unable to open and see what is it. It keeps sending me on this page and nothing happens - it just opens Play store at you app and that's about it. That's annoying. And without payong there is literally no change even to put different email adress or anything it just bugs the whole phone if you try. I do have S24 ultra - it's quite fast for anything but this app when I try to get any of your gifts."
839,3,"I kinda like the app because it looks resourceful, been having it for 3 years now but I Uninstalled at a point because I couldn't find a use for it aside log period and read chats . like , what's the point of seeing resources and yet not being granted any access to them ? like, I really want to know if there's something you can READ or DO on Flo without necessarily paying for premium. Not everyone can pay for premium use of the app ,so at least quite a few stuff should be left accessible."
840,5,"One of the Best Period Tracking Apps! I've been using Flo for a while now, and it has truly made a difference in how I track and understand my cycle. The app is beautifully designed, easy to use, and extremely accurate with predictions. I love how it not only tracks periods and ovulation but also provides insightful articles, health tips, and reminders. It‚Äôs like having a mini health assistant in my pocket."
841,1,"Tried to pay for subscription as almost everything is behind a paywall but the verification page is faulty. Input fields for verification codes don't work, nothing comes up when trying to enter numerical data. App developers need to look into this as customers can't pay for subscriptions, surprised this was not caught through QA testing."
842,1,"It was a great app until I tried to cancel after having a baby and a hysterectomy. I've spent a year trying to figure it out and it turns out I had two subscriptions, they were charging me for both and I didn't want either. It feels like you have to click a 100 times to cancel and jump through flaming hoops of fire. And you are screwed of you forget your log in or switch from IPhone to android. An absolutely terrible experience and and expensive learning curve."
843,4,love all the info you get from it definitely worth it. the only thing I wish it had was a widget that tracks the days of your cycle like a count down to it. the only widget they have is to track the growth of your baby which is awesome but not all of us are pregnant. so now I have two period apps on my phone one with a widget that show the day of my cycle and when I'm ovulating and one with an insane amount of info one everything.
844,4,"very useful for your basic needs. only thing stopping me from 5 stars is that pretty much every single feature you need to have premium for. I don't mind that for some cos obviously they gotta make money somehow but I do wish a couple more features, particularly insights about my health could perhaps be part of the free package. still a very useful app though for tracking so definitely recommend for that"
845,1,"I am not ""active"" and it keeps giving me notifications trying to make me scared, for example, ""you're 2 days late! you're 5 days late! you're 7 days late!"" this is literally just a data farming app (it collects data so it knows when you're craving chocolate, then it shows you advertisements for chocolate) zero stars"
846,2,"used to use it just to track my cycle but honestly this is not a good app at all. way too many ads and advertisements of their own app ,in app - WHILE being subscribed to premium. you can't access your information offline either. the ""useful"" insight you get is 8th grade biology at best. probably better apps out there , definitely don't reccomend this one though. you're better off tracking on paper and a calendar. and the weird kinky sex forums are... questionable"
847,5,"The app is so good, BUT, since i can't upgrade to the premium version it becomes so annoying when they ask me to, like almost everything requires premium, there are apps that can do the free options in the app without nagging about the upgrade! Please give more freedom to the users of the free version. Thank you. Update: great app, thank you so much. Recommandation: I wish you can add changes in body temperature to the symptoms feature, because many women feel reallt cold or hot during period"
848,5,"Love this app! Very easy to use and the interface is easy to understand. I downloaded it for assistance in tracking my period and ovulation for family planning purposes. And now, with its help, I'm happily 17 weeks expecting as a first time mom ü•∞ So I've switched to its pregnancy tracker feature, which has also been helpful with tidbits of interesting information!"
849,5,"I was recommended Flo by a friend as I was having irregular periods after coming off contraception. After a few periods were logged the predictions have been pretty spot on, so I feel much more at ease knowing when my period will be. I really like this app and find it most useful!"
850,1,"re-download this app because i used to use it religiously, i switched over to samsung health when i got my new phone, but its just not the same, i re-downloaded & it charged me for a subscription the day i got it, when i never signed up for one, i just wanted the basic free version just too keep track of my body and my cycle.. $40 later !!!! i love the app itself. it's very accurate, but im very aggravated that this happened üò§"
851,5,"I recently started using the Flo app to track my periods and I‚Äôm really enjoying it so far! The app looks bright, friendly, and very easy to use. It lets me log my period dates, flow, moods, symptoms, and even daily feelings, which helps me understand my body better. Flo gives clear reminders for upcoming periods, fertile windows, and ovulation days, which is super helpful. There are lots of helpful health articles and tips related to women‚Äôs health and wellness."
852,2,"I am generally happy with this application and have been using it for years. the only reason I am giving it a low rating is in hopes that a developer can address an issue I gave recently been experiencing. The functionality that I ise daily is the contraceptive reminders, but as of late the reminders do not come everyday. they skip days at random which is extremely problematic"
853,3,"it's a great app for tracking my period, but also a total cash grab. I can't look at anything to learn or for advice without needing the premium feature. the app gives a bunch of free trials, but I feel like there should be more things you could be able to do without having to pay."
854,3,"Great app, but SO FREAKING BUSY. As soon as you open the app, the freaking Flo AI companion pops up every single time (I am not interested in this feature at all and cant find a way to turn it off), a million things try to update at once, and the entire interface is just TOO MUCH. Disorganized and chaotic. I really find this app incredibly frustrating to use and extremely overstimulating even when Im NOT having a menstrual-induced migraine. When I'm actually on my period, this app is unbearable."
855,3,"overall app does what I want it to do, let's me see my cycle so I can predict around when my period happens again. although I know subscriptions help keep the up running it is a bit weird to put stuff life ""finding out why your cycle is irregular"" behind it??? or information that can be very useful about periods behind that paywall."
856,5,"I really love this app and all the symptoms you can log to help you get to know your own cycle and what to expect. I have a request to add something to the symptoms if that's possible. It would be great for position of cervix (high/low) and firmness (soft/hard) to be added, as a lot of women track this whilst trying to conceive."
857,3,i gave this app a 5 star before because of the secret chats but recently they're not updating. i can see there are posts when i click on a tag but it's not showing up on my feed. my feed is filled with old posts like from 4 to 6 days ago. AND i don't think my own posts are being shown on others feed because i don't get any responses recently when i used to get so many instantly before. I've tried logging in and out and reinstalling but no use
858,1,I'm having issues logging back in since I got a new phone. When you put in my email which is registered the account I pay for it opened a new account. The new account does not include any of my saved information nor the subscription I pay for it. Can you please provide me with someone to contact in regard to how to fix this. In the meantime I'll be canceling my subscription. Signing in has been a pain and full of pop up after pop up after pop-up even once I do get to the login screen.
859,2,"It's a very misleading app. If you don't have premium (which I had, not worth it), it'll walk you through a ""conversation"" with an AI but when you get to the end of the conversation, it tells you that you need to pay to see the answers. If you just want to track your period, it's perfectly fine for that. But if you want to read articles or have questions about your period, just use google ladies. It's free and much quicker (and you don't have to have a painful conversation with an AI)."
860,5,I love this app & how it helps me keep track of my shark week every month but it is insane on how you have to pay for this app & it being so much is ridiculous for a tracker of my shark week when I can do so with a regular calendar & or my note & reminder on my cellphone... 20 something a month or more is just not a price range everyone can afford for this app & I think it should be free to a extent but still have the options of everything unless you wanted to upgrade .
861,1,"Awful app, barely works and when it does, they either sell your data or loose it (or both). Constant pop-ups and notifications begging to pay for the monthly subscription like it's their full time job. If you enjoy getting harrased to pay so they can mishandle your personal information, you'll love it. The ceo has the same vibes as the app, desperate and shady."
862,1,"For the longest time this app has really helped me and has been accurate in tracking my flow and ovulation days but of late I feel like it has a glitch. How is it possible for it to show me that I'm fertile a day after I receive my periods!!! It doesn't update my cycle and I can't see beyond two months,right now we're in August I can't see my cycle predictions beyond October. I thought my fertile period comes two weeks after my period but in the app it shows my fertile days are two days after p"
863,4,"[Edited] Thank you so much for the feedback and for giving premium subscription‚ù§Ô∏è However after I compare Flo with a few other cycle apps, Flo lacks the cycle phase info (such as luteal phase, etc.) Please add this feature so we could specifically know which cycle phase we're in. Also please add sickness symptoms tracker such as common cold or fever, etc. I've been using Flo for 7 years and I don't want to switch. Thank you! :)"
864,3,"frustrated by how much appears to be included in the ""free"" app, yet when clicked it just tries to get you to sign up to premium. At least put the locked symbol on the front so I know not to even bother trying to look at it!"
865,5,wonderful app. sometimes not everything syncs up completely that's a bit unfortunate when looking at the summary of the month. but otherwise still a very useful app and I would recommend it to everyone. even your partner can participate with his side of the app to check in on you and the cycle.
866,2,"took 20mins to gather tons of information about myself, get all the way to end and then they make you choose a subscription to be able to fully use the app! They should tell you that from the very beginning instead of going through all the personal info for setup then not being able to use unless you pay... why does everything have to cost something...atleast state it from the beginning don't withhold until the very end!!"
867,1,"Not about helping women but profiting off women. They don't let you extract your own data for medical tracking. I have PMDD, and having an app that tracked mental+physical symptoms seemed great. I paid full, & logged symptoms for 2 years to get data for diagnosis. Nope. They keep your data and it cannot be extracted. Now, they've got rid of other useful things to help manage hormonal challenges, like weight and sleep logs. 1/8/25: can't just login if on new device! make you walk through set upüò°"
868,2,"nothing special. The assumption and articles are not that useful. Everyday pregnancy symptoms are random: today's and tomorrow's will not be the same in the app, but they are the same in life. All the app is doing is calculating weeks of pregnancy. It could be free for only one useful feature."
869,4,great app love the tracking and daily insight! I only gave it a 4 star because i think the app is a bit pricey and now you cant even see the daily insights. I did pay for a year but not anymore to pricey i can just track it in my calendar. now that I'm pregnant i will just look for another app.
870,4,I appreciate that I can use the basic functions without a subscription while I am on a fixed income. The app is easy to use and intuitive to navigate and the design and layout are very clean. The only issue I've noticed is that occasionally it will not let me apply changes in the symptom tracker unless I close the app and restart it. Otherwise it functions without issue.
871,1,"Tedious, incredibly long and scrutinicious onboarding. It must be a joke. Also, you can't skip this superlong onboarding. I couldn't log in my account, because the app won't send the password recovery link to my email. 0/10. Excel is better, ladies"
872,3,"I'm a very new user (one week), so I've got a lot to observe, but I wish you could further personalize the articles and be able to suppress what you don't want to see. I'm not yet perimenopausal or trying to get pregnant, yet that takes up a lot of space on my landing page. Other than that, so far, so good."
873,1,"Crazy how Flo has changed over the years. There used to be some educational content for free users but now it's all fear-mongering with the info hidden behind a paywall which is a cruel concept tbh. I also feel like the period predictions aren't as good as they used to be, so it's kind of become useless to me. Switching to a different app with safer privacy, too. All Flo users should keep an eye on the class action."
874,3,"This app looks great, but for me it was not simple to use, rather annoying. To much repeatable questions about how do I feel and what desease did I have, etc. Tons of other options. I just wanted to use it for tracking my periods, that's all :)"
875,4,"I have the paid version, I really like it BUT I would like to be able to filter the calendar to see what days I had certain symptoms. I can only see them manually if I click on a specific day. It has predictions but what I need is my symptoms history (all the days in the past year or so I logged in those symptoms) for medical reasons. I hope they add this feature since this medical issue is one of the reasons I started using the app in the first place. Otherwise it's great, I really love it."
876,5,(Perfect app....for me.... It is easy to handle..) that was my review 6 years back.. I should write more I think..as a user from 2018 flo never disappointed me even once...now I understand my menstrual cycle a lot more... the cycle prediction is wow..I mean 100% precise in my case...I love this app and I suggested this to many girls I know...they are also happy with it ...Lots of love keep going ‚ù§Ô∏è
877,4,"its pretty good even just using the free version. visually appealing, interesting information, and fairly customizable. one thing i dont like - when you enter your weight it defaults to what your weight ""should"" be (bmi or something similar) for your height/gender, not your last recorded weight. makes me self conscious + avoid the feature altogether"
878,3,"it's a good app for tracking your period, but literally EVERYTHING else is hidden behind a pay wall like bye. With all the access we have to other free information, there's no point in paying that much for a period tracker app."
879,2,"overall, a good app. it helps me track when im on and when im off quite nicely. my problem is the fact that you have to be on premium to get good forms of information. i cant afford premium because im 13, but my parents dont tell me these things so if Flo could it would be nice. i dont have a credit card to do the free trial either, so its disappointing."
880,5,This app is very useful and very helpful to me. I've been using this for how many years until now. I recommend this to any other girls out there. You also need this app. You can track your period anytime and you would know what's happening in your body? if there's something wrong? and if you are advance or delayed? Also if you are forgetful you badly need this.
881,3,"it's fair. I get prompts in symptom tracker needing attention, suggesting PCOS, and prompts to get a yearly subscription in order to assess in APP. Only I already know I have PCOS, was diagnosed a decade ago. would be good to be able to put that info that does impact cycles and fertility, into the app by default."
882,1,"The boyfriend side of the app is a joke. Can't see what the partner logs, get spammed with notifications, and anything else is behind a pay wall. It basically just gives you the app's cycle track, which is worthless if you have minimum communication. Switching to Clue."
883,4,"I love this app, it's helps me track my periods and you can even chat with people on there too! but the only reason I didn't rate it 5 is because if you want to do additional things and access useful information about your period other than tracking it, you need premium and I can't pay for that so it's quite a pain to not be able to get ahold of the additional information about my Period when I need it. I just don't see the new point in charging people for useful info about their periods"
884,1,"Every tap on the app takes me to a ""Unlock Premium"" page. Without paying, it's just a calendar that won't let you read any insights/tips on fertility, pregnancy, moods, symptoms, etc. Other apps do much more for free."
885,5,Having an app that helps us track is amazing.... Just wish that the free version was not as limiting or that a tracking app wasn't so expensive. I understand it's a privilege... but the reason we needed isn't as much (lol)
886,1,I love this app BUT a long time ago the app asked me if I want a lifetime subscription for a one-time fee as a limited offer and I paid for it but now it still charges me a yearly fee. This was very surprising and not Okk in my opinion. Update: I really like the app but the subscriptions are deceiving. I already have a subscription after what happened earlier but if I change the goal of my profile I have to pay more??
887,3,"It makes you pay for AI conversations and other educational topics that I would like to learn about and explore. But overall, the app is pretty accurate on when my flow will start and is very helpful on the symptoms. Would recommend it, but if you want to learn more, you have to pay."
888,2,"its a helpful app but only for tracking, you have to pay for almost everything else, and a lot of information is blocked unless you're willing to spend a bunch, it pushes you to go for premium so much wich is also annoying and it asks a lot of questions but does nothing to help you with the information you give"
889,1,"instant uninstall. not only are they invasive by wanting to stalk your activity on your phone (literally anything you search or type that isn't related to them), but of course you have to pay for it. They're not medical professionals, so you might as well pay a stranger for their opinion. there's plenty of free and noninvasive apps out there"
890,2,"No notification settings in the partner app?? This service has some great features, but I don't care for all of them. I CERTAINLY don't care to be pinged by it 2-4 times a day. I can allow or disallow notifications from the permission settings on my phone, but I can't select which types of notifications I would like to receive or ignore. I care about what my wife is experiencing, not how I can fine-tune my diet to increase my reproductive health."
891,1,"Almost all of the information and features are behind a paywall. The sex and pregnancy stuff is shoved down my throat, I just want to track my periods. Not everyone is sexually active, and not everyone wants to be pregnant. Overhyped and not that useful. I'll be looking for a new tracker app or just go back to using my wall calendar."
892,3,"Works fine. Lots of unnecessary functions like 'secret chats' and is definitely limited options for symptom tracking compared to other apps, particularly for women trying to use the app to track perimenopause or menopause symptoms"
893,3,"Ising this for 2 yrs now, paid version for 1.5 yrs. I stopped paying bc I never got pregnant, & didnt want to keep trying at this point. It is an okay period tracker but my fitbit was closer to what my cycle is. The app has more options for symptoms & other tags that are really better than fitbit. You dont actually get doctors advice & the pop ?s are a waste of time. I can add my pd dates better than fitbit. Overall experience is ok. For me, fitbit is better."
894,2,It used to be free. Not sure how all of a sudden they want to charge for everything. That's the downside for me. It's almost impossible nowadays to just find a period tracker that does what you want without the hassle of buying or having a subscription.
895,5,"Flo really helps to track periods and very very helpful for pregnancy. I had tried other app during pregnancy but those were very difficult to understand and paid as well but thank god Flo was there it is easy to use, easy to understand and most important free as well. Its my favorite app for tracking."
896,4,I have been using this app for like 3 years and had no complain.... it was very convenient but for about a month or so i haven't been able to see any stories pr graphs articles secret chats nothing.... like its just plain log your period.... even after logging symptoms there's no longer any stories or articles coming up like earlier or chat Kindly help me with this
897,3,"its great but its also never accurate. im not going to spend that much money every month for consistent inaccuracies. ive been using flo since either 2019 or 2018 and my period has been wrong since day 1. also- pregnancy dates are always off, too, even though im well aware of the two times to the day I conceived."
898,5,"I don't usually leave reviews on apps and I realise a lot of people see the pay wall blocking a great deal of the content on this and dislike the app because of that. However, I have found the secret chats section on this genuinely very helpful. It had given me a place to turn to fellow women who non-judgementally have given me advice on my physical and mental health."
899,2,"Tracking within itself is functional and easy to understand. However, if you dont pay for the better version, then the usefulness of the app is lost. you can't read articles for free or track more than normal symptoms for free either."
900,2,"Good period tracker but I feel like showing me insights that are helpful but locked behind a paywall defeats the whole purpose. I'd gotten the app because hey, an app that provides help and tips with intimate health. I had no idea that the inisghts were locked behind the subscription, nor do I have money to spare monthly for one, so to me the app is just a nice looking tracker with a lot of helpful but inaccessible articles that bloat the app unless I pay."
901,5,"I've only had Flo for a couple of weeks, but so far, I love it. It's already given me a lot more insight on what I need to know and calculated my period better than previous trackers I've used. My goal is to get pregnant, which is difficult for me because I only have one fallopian tube and ovary. I'm going to keep using Flo, and I'll come back with an update eventually."
902,3,"the app is cool, but they're 2 things irritate me. One is I think there are no possibility to turn off the chat bubbles appearing when you open the app. I just don't use that helper tool, i don't need it, but it appears on top of the content each time. The second is if I turn on the dark mode on my phone (Xiaomi redmi 8) some elements adapt to it, while others not. so i can't use the app because all important content I use daily is white text on white background"
903,5,"This is a great app. It helps me track my period, and record my daily routine. The predictions was near accurate. Sometimes, I'm only just a day late or advance. They also had a community in the app, and some conversation to help with your situation you're in. But, I hope they could offer a lifetime premium."
904,1,"The interface was incredibly annoying. instead of being able to do things easily, the app forces you to ""chat"" with a bot, but it pre-populates your response, so you aren't even chatting. Just wasting time. I wish it had a better interface as it does have good features, but it just isn't usable."
905,5,"I don't do the paid version. I just can't afford extra things right now, but even the free version really helps to monitor and track stuff when you're at the time of your life where you need to stop with birth control. It's just not something that agrees with my body.Anymore, and with age, there has to be new methods.I really appreciate this app"
906,3,"This app has so much information about very select topics. However if you happen to be transitioning off oral contraception and in a phase where your cycle just isn't regular because of this, there is just no way to log this on the app or get it to help you transition. This is unfortunate because that transition can take up to 12 months. It seems Flo is only helpful if you are able to work out your regular cycle on or off contraception. No in between. So in my case, not useful."
907,3,"it's a great tracking app but I'm a trans man so seeing the almost hyper-feminine notifications and focus just sucks. I know it's meant as a menstruation tracker and usually only women menstruate but it'd be nice to have a switch or something that makes it less gendered. literally all I want is to know what's going on down there not ""let's make his night"" ""how to get down there smelling nice and fresh for him"" like please just tell me why I'm actively wanting to throw a plate on the ground."
908,2,I used this app for years but ive decided to change. Every time I open it I need to close multiple ads. Want to open the calendar to check when your last period was? Ad. Close the calendar and go back to main page? Ad. Log a period? Hey this is unusual! We can help figure you out why! and when you click on it its behind a paywall again I understand the premium features and the need to promote but there's a difference between promoting and being annoying to the point of making your app unusable
909,4,"I'm giving 4 stars because I wish I would've known I had to have a subscription. Maybe it was listed at the front and I missed it. But other then that, the UI is better than the period tracking app I was using before, and I can do a lot more with it as well. I haven't run into any issues so far. I'm happy with the switch!"
910,4,"Best app for woman (above 18). This app approximately predicts the period day and following cycles. lots of blogs and animated videos are available to learn about womanhood physically and mentally, also includes self-care, period care, mental health blogs and intimate related topics and so on. You can also enter your daily mood and journal in it. Plus, it gives public messaging options to engage with others about our doubts. (some matured content blog are available so not recommended for teens)"

It's indeed a GIRL app. From your period tracking, to pregnancy info, to health care. it's all you need."
912,1,"I canceled this subscription around a month ago, and they tried to charge my bank at least 4 different times before the due date on June 25th. Again, they've tried several unauthorized transactions that I have bank proof of. Even though it obviously says I've canceled my subscription. Do not use the pay part of this app if you use it at all"
913,2,"rating for the content mostly, not the app itself. The flo for partners content is really limited, and has almost no value. I would be much more interested in what is on my spouse app instead, and it would be significantly more helpful. the gamification aspect is annoying (stories/quizzes) the app itself is fine."
914,4,"Currently testing the free trial, and I am impressed so far. Love the extra resources, articles and message boards, which creates a great sense of community. My only constructive feedback is that it seems very American (references to OBGYN etc.), options for other countries and their terminology might be a good addition?"
915,2,"I am noticing that, like clockwork, this app always freezes when I try to log days if the cache is above 20 mb- I tap apply and nothing happens. The only difference since the last update is that I also have to reboot my phone and use force stop to get it to work. I gave this 2 stars because the predictions are helpful."
916,4,Like the app. Have been using it for many years infact and always gave me accurate predictions. I recently changed my phone and downloaded this again but only now realise there's too much nonsense to even get started or log into the account. Users might get frustrated even before they begin using the app tbh.
917,5,"Flo is a very good period tracker app , I think during the time I've used it only one prediction of my period starting was wrong but it was because of stress and not eating properly, the articles have also helped me a lot, helping me understand my body and how it works!!"
918,2,"Doesn't really describe the actual different phases during the menstrual cycle, which would be useful and it also forces sex on you which makes me uncomfortable. I dont want too see that stuff and its all over the app. The filter only turns off some things. Also most of the useful stuff is included in premium"
919,3,"I like how flo is not only able to track your period, but it gives you helpful tips on how to manage your period, and also just the health of my body in general. I love the little comment section where people can ask questions. It's really helpful, I just wish I could be able to utilize more of the app without having to pay."
920,1,"After about the 5th pop-up asking me to accept the free trial interrupted the article I was reading, I accepted it. just to close out the app & reslize that I has immediately been charged fit a month's subscription. I tried contacting the company after Google play denied my request for a refund, but have yet to get any type of response. I do not need or want thr paid version of this app. Therefore am giving it 1 star."
